# Localization Program

The Translation Program is a collaborative effort to translate various documents related to TON into multiple languages, making the website more accessible to billions of non-English speakers worldwide.

## System Design Philosophy

The localization program is **launched** and **actively maintained** by [**TownSquare Labs**](https://github.com/TownSquareXYZ), one of the closest partners of **TON**.

We are committed to creating an open infrastructure for multilingual community collaboration to **advance TON to a better phase**, which includes:

1. **Suitable for multilingual communities**  
   The program supports multiple languages, ensuring inclusivity and ease of access for users from diverse linguistic backgrounds.

2. **Automate development, integration, and deployment**  
   By leveraging automation tools, the program streamlines the processes of development, integration, and deployment, reducing manual efforts and enhancing efficiency and consistency across all localization efforts.

3. **Decoupling the roles of developer, translator, and verifier**  
   Our approach separates the responsibilities of developers, translators, and verifiers, allowing each role to focus on their specific tasks. This ensures high-quality translations and smooth collaboration without overlap or conflict of duties.

4. **Community contribution incentive**  
   We provide incentives for community members who contribute to the localization process. This encourages active participation and rewards those who help improve the program, fostering a sense of ownership and community spirit.

5. **Integration of advanced AI systems**  
   Advanced AI systems enhance translation accuracy and efficiency by providing intelligent suggestions and automating repetitive tasks, ensuring high-quality results with less effort.

This project is not just for speakers of a single language; our goal is **to serve the global developer ecosystem**.

## Acknowledgments
We are highly thankful to the thousands of community members who are the key part of the Translation Program. We want to acknowledge our translators and support them on their career paths. We will recognize our top translators by creating leaderboards and a list of all contributors to the Translation Program in the near future.
