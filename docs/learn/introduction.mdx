# The Open Network


__The Open Network (TON)__ is a decentralized and open internet platform made up of several components. These include: TON Blockchain, TON DNS, TON Storage, and TON Sites. TON Blockchain is the core protocol that connects TON’s underlying infrastructure together to form the greater TON Ecosystem.

TON is focused on achieving widespread cross-chain interoperability, while operating in a highly scalable secure framework. TON is designed to process millions of transactions per second (TPS), with the goal of eventually reaching hundreds of millions of users moving forward.

__TON Blockchain__ is designed as a distributed supercomputer, or “_superserver_,” intended to provide a variety of products and services to contribute to the development of the decentralized vision for the new internet.
