# Single Nominator Pool

[Single Nominator](https://github.com/orbs-network/single-nominator) is a new TON smart contract that enables secure validation for TON blockchain via an air gapped cold wallet.The contract is designed for TON validators that have enough self stake to validate by themselves without relying on third-party nominators.

The contract provides an alternative simplified implementation for the core team’s Nominator Pool smart contract that supports a single nominator only. The benefit of this implementation is that it's more secure since the attack surface is considerably smaller. This is due to a massive reduction in complexity of the Nominator Pool that has to support multiple third-party nominators.

## Start using mytonctrl

Currently [mytonctrl](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/mytonctrl) supports `single_nominator` contracts, but firstly you need to install mytonctrl 2.0.

### Launch mytonctrl 2.0

If you already have installed mytonctrl just use command `update mytonctrl2`. If you have no mytonctrl installed, follow these steps:

1. Download installation script:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ton-blockchain/mytonctrl/mytonctrl2/scripts/install.sh
```

2. Run installation script:

```bash
sudo bash ./install.sh -b mytonctrl2
```

### Set up single-nominator

After you have created and activated validator's wallet, follow these steps:

1. Enable single nominator mode

```bash
MyTonCtrl> enable_mode single-nominator
```

2. Create pool

```bash
MyTonCtrl> new_single_pool <pool-name> <owner_address>
```

3. Type `pools_list` to display pool addresses

4. Send 1 TON to the pool and activate it

```bash
MyTonCtrl> activate_single_pool <pool-name>
```

Now you can work with this pool via mytonctrl like with a standard nominator pool.

## Start without mytonctrl

#### Prepare launched Validator

  If you have mytonctrl installed and validator running:

  1. Stop validation and withdraw all funds.

#### Prepare from the beginning
  If you had no Validator before, do the following:
   1. [Run a Validator](/participate/run-nodes/full-node) and make sure it's synced.
   2. Stop validation and withdraw all funds.


### Prepare Single Nominator


1. Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en) v.16 and later and npm  ([detailed instructions](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#debian-and-ubuntu-based-distributions))

2. Install `ts-node` and `arg` module

```bash
$ sudo apt install ts-node
$ sudo npm i arg -g
```

4. Create symlinks for compilers:

```bash
$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/ton/crypto/fift /usr/local/bin/fift
$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/ton/crypto/func /usr/local/bin/func
```

5. Run test to make sure everything is set up properly:

```bash
$ npm run test
```

6. Replace mytonctrl nominator-pool scripts: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orbs-network/single-nominator/main/mytonctrl-scripts/install-pool-scripts.sh

### Create Single Nominator Pool

1. Get Toncenter API key from a Telegram [@tonapibot](https://t.me/tonapibot)
2. Set env variables:

```bash
export OWNER_ADDRESS=<owner_address>
export VALIDATOR_ADDRESS=<validator_wallet_address>
export TON_ENDPOINT=https://toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC
export TON_API_KEY=<toncenter api key>
```

2. Create deployer address:

```bash
$ npm run init-deploy-wallet
Insufficient Deployer [EQAo5U...yGgbvR] funds 0
```

3. Topup deployer address with 2.1 TON
4. Deploy pool contract, you will get pool address: `Ef-kC0..._WLqgs`:

```
$ npm run deploy
```

5. Convert address to .addr:

```
$ fift -s ./scripts/fift/str-to-addr.fif Ef-kC0..._WLqgs
```

(Saving address to file single-nominator.addr)

6. Backup deployer private key "./build/deploy.config.json" and "single-nominator.addr" files
7. Copy "single-nominator.addr" to "mytoncore/pools/single-nominator-1.addr"
8. Send stake from owner address to single nominator address

### Withdrawals from Single Nominator

Using wallets to withdraw from Single Nominator
Fift:

1. Create "withdraw.boc" request with amount:

```bash
$ fift -s ./scripts/fift/withdraw.fif <withdraw_amount>
```

2. Create and sign request from owner's wallet:

```bash
$ fift -s wallet-v3.fif <my-wallet> <single_nominator_address> <sub_wallet_id> <seqno> <amount=1> -B withdraw.boc
```

3. Broadcast query:

```bash
$ lite-client -C global.config.json -c 'sendfile wallet-query.boc'
tons
```

1. Create "withdraw.boc" request with amount:

```bash
$ fift -s ./scripts/fift/withdraw.fif <withdraw_amount>
```

2. Send request to single nominator address:

a.

```bash
$ tons wallet transfer <my-wallet> <single_nominator_address> <amount=1> --body withdraw.boc
tonkeeper
```

b.

```
npm link typescript
```

c.

```
npx ts-node scripts/ts/withdraw-deeplink.ts <single-nominator-addr> <withdraw-amount>
```

d. Open deeplink on the owner's phone

## Stop participating

If user doesn't want to take part in validating anymore it's possible to withdraws the funds from the Single Nominator contract to validators personal wallet.
