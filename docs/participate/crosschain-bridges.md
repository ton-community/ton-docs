# Cross-chain bridges

Decentralized cross-chain bridges operate on the TON Blockchain, allowing you to transfer assets from the TON Blockchain to other blockchains and vice versa.

## Toncoin Bridge

The Toncoin bridge allows you to transfer Toncoins between TON Blockchain and the Ethereum blockchain, as well as between the TON Blockchain and the BNB Smart Chain.

The bridge is managed by decentralized oracles.
