# TON Connect for Python

The recommended SDK for Python applications is [tonutils](https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/ton-connect/guidelines/developers#ton-connect-python).
It is a Python library that provides a high-level interface for interacting with the TON blockchain, including TON Connect.

## Implementation

### Installation

```bash
pip install tonutils
```

To store user wallet connection data, you need to implement a storage interface. An additional dependency is required for this. In this example, a file-based implementation using `aiofiles` is used:

```bash
pip install aiofiles
```

### Creating the Manifest

Create the `manifest.json` file for your application according to the [guidelines](https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/ton-connect/guidelines/creating-manifest), and host it at a publicly accessible URL.

### Implementing Storage

To store connection data with user wallets, a storage interface must be implemented.

<details>
  <summary><b>Example implementation</b></summary>

```python
import json
import os
from asyncio import Lock
from typing import Dict, Optional

import aiofiles

from tonutils.tonconnect import IStorage


class FileStorage(IStorage):

    def __init__(self, file_path: str):
        self.file_path = file_path
        self.lock = Lock()

        if not os.path.exists(self.file_path):
            with open(self.file_path, "w") as f:
                json.dump({}, f)  # type: ignore

    async def _read_data(self) -> Dict[str, str]:
        async with self.lock:
            async with aiofiles.open(self.file_path, "r") as f:
                content = await f.read()
                if content:
                    return json.loads(content)
                return {}

    async def _write_data(self, data: Dict[str, str]) -> None:
        async with self.lock:
            async with aiofiles.open(self.file_path, "w") as f:
                await f.write(json.dumps(data, indent=4))

    async def set_item(self, key: str, value: str) -> None:
        data = await self._read_data()
        data[key] = value
        await self._write_data(data)

    async def get_item(self, key: str, default_value: Optional[str] = None) -> Optional[str]:
        data = await self._read_data()
        return data.get(key, default_value)

    async def remove_item(self, key: str) -> None:
        data = await self._read_data()
        if key in data:
            del data[key]
            await self._write_data(data)
```

</details>

### Initializing TON Connect

Create a `TonConnect` instance by specifying the manifest URL and the storage object:

```python
from storage import FileStorage
from tonutils.tonconnect import TonConnect

TC_MANIFEST_URL = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nessshon/tonutils/main/examples/tonconnect/tonconnect-manifest.json"
TC_STORAGE = FileStorage("connection.json")

tc = TonConnect(
    storage=TC_STORAGE,
    manifest_url=TC_MANIFEST_URL,
    wallets_fallback_file_path="./wallets.json"
)
```

The `wallets_fallback_file_path` parameter is used as a fallback source of wallet data (e.g., Tonkeeper, Wallet) in case the external API is unavailable.
You can find all input parameters at the following [link](https://github.com/nessshon/tonutils/blob/main/tonutils/tonconnect/tonconnect.py#L40).

### Initializing the Connector

Create a `Connector` instance to work with a specific user:

```python
connector = await tc.init_connector(user_id)
```

* `user_id` can be an integer (`int`) or a string (`str`).
* If not provided, an incremental ID will be assigned automatically.
* You can store the user ID for future reference:

  ```python
  user_id = connector.user_id
  ```

## Connecting a Wallet

### Retrieving the List of Wallets

To display available wallets in the user interface, retrieve the list of supported wallets:

```python
wallets = await tc.get_wallets()
```

You can then display the list using each wallet’s name via `wallet.name`.

### Connecting to a Wallet

After the user selects a wallet from the list, initiate the connection (for example, selecting the wallet at index 1):

```python
selected_wallet = wallets[1]
connect_url = await connector.connect_wallet(selected_wallet)
```

You should present the `connect_url` to the user in your application.

#### With Redirect URL

If you want to automatically redirect the user after a successful connection, pass the `redirect_url` parameter:

```python
redirect_url = "https://example.com/"
connect_url = await connector.connect_wallet(selected_wallet, redirect_url=redirect_url)
```

#### With TON Proof

To ensure that the user truly owns the specified address, you can enable address ownership verification using `ton_proof`.
Generate the proof payload and pass it via the `ton_proof` parameter.
More details on this mechanism and payload generation are available [here](https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/ton-connect/guidelines/verifying-signed-in-users).

You can also use the built-in `generate_proof_payload` function from `tonutils`:

```python
from tonutils.tonconnect.utils import generate_proof_payload

redirect_url = "https://example.com/"
proof_payload = generate_proof_payload()
connect_url = await connector.connect_wallet(
    selected_wallet,
    redirect_url=redirect_url,
    ton_proof=proof_payload
)
```

### Handling the Connection

To handle the result of a wallet connection, use the `connect_wallet_context` context manager.

**Example using the context manager:**

```python
from tonutils.tonconnect.utils.exceptions import TonConnectError, UserRejectsError

async with connector.connect_wallet_context() as response:
    if isinstance(response, TonConnectError):
        if isinstance(response, UserRejectsError):
            print("The user rejected the connection.")
        else:
            print(f"Connection error: {response.message}")
    else:
        print(f"Connected wallet: {response.account.address.to_str(is_bounceable=False)}")
```

**Example with `ton_proof` verification:**

```python
from tonutils.tonconnect.utils.exceptions import TonConnectError, UserRejectsError

async with connector.connect_wallet_context() as response:
    if isinstance(response, TonConnectError):
        if isinstance(response, UserRejectsError):
            print("The user rejected the connection.")
        else:
            print(f"Connection error: {response.message}")
    else:
        if connector.wallet.verify_proof_payload(proof_payload):
            print(f"Connected wallet: {response.account.address.to_str(is_bounceable=False)}")
        else:
            await connector.disconnect_wallet()
            print("Proof verification failed.")
```

The context manager will pause execution until:

* the user connects a wallet;
* a timeout occurs;
* or an error is raised.

On success, you will receive a [WalletInfo](https://github.com/nessshon/tonutils/blob/main/tonutils/tonconnect/models/wallet.py#L118) object containing the connected wallet's data.
On failure, a `TonConnectError` instance will be returned, which you can handle as described in the [connection errors](#connection-errors) section.

## Sending Requests

### Sending a Transaction

To send Toncoin to a specific address, use the `send_transaction` method:

```python
from tonutils.tonconnect.models import Transaction, Message

rpc_request_id = await connector.send_transaction(
    transaction=Transaction(
        valid_until=int(time.time() + 5 * 60),
        messages=[
            Message(
                address="UQCZq3_Vd21-4y4m7Wc-ej9NFOhh_qvdfAkAYAOHoQ__Ness",
                amount=str(int(1 * 1e9)),
            )
        ]
    )
)
```

* `valid_until` – transaction expiration time in seconds
* `address` – recipient in user-friendly format
* `amount` – amount in nanotons

The method returns `rpc_request_id`, a unique identifier for tracking the request.

### Sending a Simplified Transfer

The `tonutils` library also provides higher-level methods for sending transactions more conveniently.

* The `valid_until` field is set to 5 minutes by default.
* The `address` field is replaced with `destination` (a string or an `Address`).
* The `amount` should be specified in **TON** instead of **nanotons**.
* The `body` parameter can be one of the following:

  * a `Cell` object — for passing a custom payload;
  * a string — used as a comment or memo;

#### Single Transfer

```python
rpc_request_id = await connector.send_transfer(
    destination="UQCZq3_Vd21-4y4m7Wc-ej9NFOhh_qvdfAkAYAOHoQ__Ness",
    amount=1,
    body="Hello from tonutils!",
)
```

#### Batch Transfer

Before sending multiple messages in one transaction, ensure the wallet supports the required number of messages:

```python
max_messages = connector.device.get_max_supported_messages(connector.wallet)
```

The maximum number of messages supported in a single transaction depends on the wallet version.
Use this limit to shape your transaction logic appropriately.

```python
from tonutils.tonconnect.models.transfer import TransferMessage

rpc_request_id = await connector.send_batch_transfer(
    messages=[
        TransferMessage(
            destination="UQCZq3_Vd21-4y4m7Wc-ej9NFOhh_qvdfAkAYAOHoQ__Ness",
            amount=1,
            body="Hello from tonutils!",
        ),
        TransferMessage(
            destination="UQCZq3_Vd21-4y4m7Wc-ej9NFOhh_qvdfAkAYAOHoQ__Ness",
            amount=2,
            body="Hello from tonutils!",
        ),
    ]
)
```

These methods also return an `rpc_request_id`.

### Sending a Sign Data Request

The `sign_data` method allows requesting a cryptographic signature from the user’s wallet for arbitrary content.
This signature confirms explicit consent and can be verified off-chain or passed into a smart contract.

TON Connect supports three data formats:

#### Text

Use when the content is human-readable.

* Clear to the user.
* Ideal for off-chain confirmations.

```python
from tonutils.tonconnect.models import SignDataPayloadText

text = "I confirm deletion of my account and all associated data."
payload = SignDataPayloadText(text=text)
```

#### Binary

Use for hashes, files, or non-readable content.

* Suitable for digital receipts, proofs, or opaque payloads.

```python
from tonutils.tonconnect.models import SignDataPayloadBinary

data = "I confirm deletion of my account and all associated data.".encode("utf-8")
payload = SignDataPayloadBinary(bytes=data)
```

#### Cell

Use when the signature must be verifiable on-chain.

* Supports TL-B schemas.
* Enables smart contract validation.

```python
from pytoniq_core import begin_cell
from tonutils.tonconnect.models import SignDataPayloadCell

comment = "I confirm deletion of my account and all associated data."
cell = begin_cell().store_uint(0, 32).store_snake_string(comment).end_cell()
schema = "text_comment#00000000 text:Snakedata = InMsgBody;"

payload = SignDataPayloadCell(cell=cell, schema=schema)
```

The last type in the provided TL-B schema is used as the root type for serialization.

#### Sending the Request

Before sending the request, you must ensure that the connected wallet supports the sign data feature.
Use the following check:

```python
connector.device.verify_sign_data_feature(connector.wallet, payload)
```

If the feature is not supported, a `WalletNotSupportFeatureError` will be raised.
You can handle it like this:

```python
from tonutils.tonconnect.utils.exceptions import WalletNotSupportFeatureError

try:
    connector.device.verify_sign_data_feature(connector.wallet, payload)
except WalletNotSupportFeatureError:
    print("Wallet does not support sign data feature!")
    # Handle fallback logic or abort
```

If the feature is supported, proceed to send the request:

```python
rpc_request_id = await connector.sign_data(payload)
```

### Handling Request Results

Use the `pending_request_context` context manager to wait for a user’s response to both transaction and signing requests.

The context manager pauses execution until:

* the user takes action in their wallet;
* a timeout occurs;
* or an error is raised.

On success, it returns a response object specific to the request type:

* [`SendTransactionResponse`](https://github.com/nessshon/tonutils/blob/main/tonutils/tonconnect/models/request.py#L245)
* [`SignDataResponse`](https://github.com/nessshon/tonutils/blob/main/tonutils/tonconnect/models/request.py#L494)

On failure, a `TonConnectError` is returned and can be handled as described in the [request errors](#request-errors) section.

#### Handling Signed Data

```python
from tonutils.tonconnect.utils.exceptions import TonConnectError, UserRejectsError

async with connector.pending_request_context(rpc_request_id) as response:
    if isinstance(response, TonConnectError):
        if isinstance(response, UserRejectsError):
            print("The user rejected the signing request.")
        else:
            print(f"Sign data error: {response.message}")
    else:
        key = connector.wallet.account.public_key
        if response.verify_sign_data(key):
            print("Verified sign data!")
        else:
            print("Failed to verify sign data!")
```

#### Handling the Transaction

```python
from tonutils.tonconnect.utils.exceptions import TonConnectError, UserRejectsError

async with connector.pending_request_context(rpc_request_id) as response:
    if isinstance(response, TonConnectError):
        if isinstance(response, UserRejectsError):
            print("The user rejected the transaction.")
        else:
            print(f"Transaction error: {response.message}")
    else:
        print(f"Transaction sent successfully! Hash: {response.normalized_hash}")
```

### Checking Request Status

To check whether a request is still waiting for user confirmation:

```python
is_pending = connector.is_request_pending(rpc_request_id)
```

This method returns `True` if the request has not yet been confirmed in the user's wallet; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Cancelling a Request

If you need to cancel a request for any reason, use:

```python
connector.cancel_pending_request(rpc_request_id)
```

This completely stops processing the request at the application level, even if the user later confirms it in the wallet.

## Disconnecting the Wallet

To disconnect the user's wallet, call the `disconnect_wallet` method:

```python
await connector.disconnect_wallet()
```

## Event Handling

In addition to context managers, **tonutils** provides a unified event-driven interface for reacting to wallet actions.
This allows you to handle events such as wallet connection, disconnection, transaction execution, and data signing through registered handlers.

### Event Types

TON Connect emits two categories of events:

#### Success Events

These events are triggered when an action completes successfully:

* `Event.CONNECT` — emitted when a wallet is successfully connected.
  **Parameters:** `user_id: int`, `wallet: WalletInfo`

* `Event.DISCONNECT` — emitted when a wallet is disconnected.
  **Parameters:** `user_id: int`, `wallet: WalletInfo`

* `Event.TRANSACTION` — emitted when a transaction is confirmed by the user.
  **Parameters:** `user_id: int`, `transaction: SendTransactionResponse`, `rpc_request_id: int`

* `Event.SIGN_DATA` — emitted when a sign data request is approved.
  **Parameters:** `user_id: int`, `sign_data: SignDataResponse`, `rpc_request_id: int`

#### Error Events

These events are triggered **if the corresponding action fails** due to user rejection, timeout, or internal wallet/app errors:

* `EventError.CONNECT` — error during wallet connection.
* `EventError.DISCONNECT` — error during wallet disconnection.
* `EventError.TRANSACTION` — error during transaction confirmation.
* `EventError.SIGN_DATA` — error during sign data request.

  **All error events receive:**

  * `user_id: int`
  * `error: TonConnectError`

  **Note:** All error types are described in detail in the [error handling](#error-handling) section.

You can handle these errors the same way as standard events using `register_event` or decorators.
This separation allows you to keep success and failure logic cleanly isolated.

### Handling Events

You can register event handlers in two ways:

#### Using method

```python
def on_transaction(user_id: int, transaction: SendTransactionResponse):
    print(f"Transaction received for user {user_id}")

tc.register_event(Event.TRANSACTION, on_transaction)
```

#### Using decorators

```python
@tc.on_event(Event.TRANSACTION)
async def on_transaction(user_id: int, transaction: SendTransactionResponse):
    print(f"Transaction confirmed for user {user_id}")
```

### Additional Parameters

In addition to standard event arguments, you can pass custom parameters (e.g., database session, context objects, comments) to your event handlers.

#### Attaching parameters to a specific event:

Use `add_event_kwargs` before entering the context manager or triggering the request:

```python
connector.add_event_kwargs(
    event=Event.CONNECT,
    comment="Hello from tonutils!",
    db_session=session,
)
```

The extra keyword arguments will be passed directly to the corresponding handler:

```python
@tc.on_event(Event.CONNECT)
async def on_connect(user_id: int, wallet: WalletInfo, comment: str, db_session: Session):
    ...
```

#### Defining global parameters for all events:

You can define default parameters for all events at the connector level:

```python
tc = TonConnect(
    storage=TC_STORAGE,
    manifest_url=TC_MANIFEST_URL,
    wallets_fallback_file_path="./wallets.json"
)
tc["db_session"] = session
tc["comment"] = "Shared message"
```

These parameters will be available in **all** event handlers:

```python
@tc.on_event(Event.SIGN_DATA)
async def on_sign_data(user_id: int, sign_data: SignDataResponse, db_session: Session, comment: str):
    ...
```

## Error Handling

When working with TON Connect, errors may occur both during wallet connection and when sending requests.

### Connection Errors

These errors can occur during the wallet connection initialization process:

| Code | Error                     | Description                                                               |
|------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0    | `UnknownError`            | An unknown error occurred in the wallet during request processing.        |
| 1    | `BadRequestError`         | The request is malformed or contains invalid parameters.                  |
| 2    | `ManifestNotFoundError`   | The specified `manifest_url` is unreachable or does not exist.            |
| 3    | `ManifestContentError`    | The manifest content has an invalid structure or is improperly formatted. |
| 100  | `UnknownAppError`         | Application logic error while preparing the request data.                 |
| 300  | `UserRejectsError`        | The user declined to connect their wallet to your application.            |
| 400  | `MethodNotSupportedError` | The selected wallet does not support the requested operation or method.   |
| 500  | `RequestTimeoutError`     | The user did not complete the connection within the allotted time.        |

### Request Errors

These errors may occur when processing requests.

| Code | Error                     | Description                                                             |
|------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0    | `UnknownError`            | An unknown error occurred in the wallet during request processing.      |
| 1    | `BadRequestError`         | The request is malformed or contains invalid parameters.                |
| 100  | `UnknownAppError`         | Application logic error while preparing the request data.               |
| 300  | `UserRejectsError`        | The user rejected the request or refused to sign.                       |
| 400  | `MethodNotSupportedError` | The selected wallet does not support the requested operation or method. |
| 500  | `RequestTimeoutError`     | The user did not confirm the request within the allotted time.          |

## Conclusion

TON Connect provides a secure and user-friendly way to interact with wallets on the TON blockchain. With support for transaction signing, identity verification, and event handling, it enables seamless integration of wallet functionality into Python applications.
