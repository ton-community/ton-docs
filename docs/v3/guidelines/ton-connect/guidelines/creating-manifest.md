# Creating manifest.json

Every app needs a manifest to pass meta information to the wallet. The manifest is a JSON file named as `tonconnect-manifest.json` following format:

esc```json
{
    "url": "<app-url>",                        // required
    "name": "<app-name>",                      // required
    "iconUrl": "<app-icon-url>",               // required
    "termsOfUseUrl": "<terms-of-use-url>",     // optional
    "privacyPolicyUrl": "<privacy-policy-url>" // optional
}
```

## Example

You can find an example of the manifest below:

```json
{
    "url": "https://ton.vote",
    "name": "TON Vote",
    "iconUrl": "https://ton.vote/logo.png"
}
```
## Best practices

- The best practice is to place the manifest in the root of your app and repository, e.g. `https://myapp.com/tonconnect-manifest.json`. It allows the wallet to handle your app better and improve the UX connected to your app.
- Ensure that the `manifest.json` file is accessible via a GET request at its URL
