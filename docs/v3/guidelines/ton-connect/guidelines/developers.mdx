# TON Connect SDKs

## SDK List

:::info
We recommend using the [@tonconnect/ui-react](https://github.com/ton-connect/sdk/tree/main/packages/ui-react) kit for your DApps. Only switch to lower levels of the SDK or reimplement your protocol version if your product requires it.

## TON Connect JS SDK

The TON Connect repository contains the following main packages:

- [@tonconnect/ui](/v3/guidelines/ton-connect/guidelines/developers#ton-connect-ui) - TON Connect User Interface (UI)
- [@tonconnect/sdk](/v3/guidelines/ton-connect/guidelines/developers#ton-connect-sdk)  - TON Connect SDK
- [@tonconnect/protocol](/v3/guidelines/ton-connect/guidelines/developers#ton-connect-protocol-models) - TON Connect protocol specifications

### TON Connect UI

TON Connect UI is a UI kit for TON Connect SDK. Use it to connect your app to TON wallets via the TON Connect protocol. It allows you to integrate TON Connect into your app more efficiently using our UI elements, such as the **connect wallet** button, **select wallet** dialog, and **confirmation** modals.

```bash
npm i @tonconnect/ui
```

- [GitHub](https://github.com/ton-connect/sdk/tree/main/packages/ui)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tonconnect/ui)
- [API Documentation](https://ton-connect.github.io/sdk/modules/_tonconnect_ui.html)

The TON Connect **User Interface (UI)** is a framework that allows developers to improve and unify the user **experience (UX)** for TON application users.

Developers can easily integrate TON Connect with apps using simple UI elements such as the connect wallet button, select wallet dialog, and confirmation modals. Here are three primary examples of how TON Connect improves UX in apps:

- Example of app functionality in the DApp browser: [GitHub](https://ton-connect.github.io/demo-dapp/)
- Example of the backend part for the DApp above: [GitHub](https://github.com/ton-connect/demo-dapp-backend)
- Example of a bridge server using Go: [GitHub](https://github.com/ton-connect/bridge)

This kit simplifies the implementation of TON Connect in apps built for TON Blockchain.
Standard frontend frameworks are supported, as well as applications built without specific frameworks.

### TON Connect SDK

The TON Connect SDK is the lowest level of the three frameworks that help developers integrate TON Connect into their applications. It primarily connects apps to wallets through the TON Connect protocol.

- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tonconnect/sdk)

### TON Connect protocol models

This package contains protocol requests, protocol responses, event models, and encoding and decoding functions. Developers may use this to integrate TON Connect into wallet apps written in TypeScript. In order to integrate TON Connect into a DApp, use the [@tonconnect/sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tonconnect/sdk).

- [GitHub](https://github.com/ton-connect/sdk/tree/main/packages/protocol)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tonconnect/protocol)

## General questions and concerns
