# TON Sites for Applications

## How to support TON Site in your Application?

You can launch TON Sites from your application by integrating a local entry-proxy into your product.

There is an existing library and the following examples:

* [Andriod](https://github.com/andreypfau/tonutils-proxy-android-example)
* [iOS](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton-proxy-swift)

:::caution
Public entry-proxies were launched exclusively for familiarization and tests; please do not use them.
