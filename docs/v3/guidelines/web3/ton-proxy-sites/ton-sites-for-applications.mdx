# TON Sites for Applications

## How to support a TON Site in your application?

You can launch a TON Site in your application by directly integrating a local [entry proxy](/v3/guidelines/web3/ton-proxy-sites/running-your-own-ton-proxy#running-an-entry-proxy) into your product.
Libraries and example integrations are available for popular platforms:

- [Android](https://github.com/andreypfau/tonutils-proxy-android-example)
- [iOS](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton-proxy-swift)

:::caution
Public entry proxies are intended only for demonstration and testing purposes. Please do not use them in production.
