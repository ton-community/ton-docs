# How to open any TON Site?

This article explains the most common ways to access TON Sites from different devices.

Each method has its advantages and limitations. The list begins with the most straightforward options and progresses to more advanced configurations.

## Easy methods

### Browse through the ton.run or tonp.io

The simplest way to access a TON Site is through services like [ton.run](https://ton.run). No installation or setup is required — just open the **ton.run** or **tonp.io** and browse TON Sites.

This method is helpful for casual browsing or quick checks. However, it is not recommended for regular use due to several drawbacks:

- Your internet traffic is routed through a third-party service, e.g., ton.run. 
- The service may go offline or stop functioning at any time.
- Your internet service provider may block it.


### TON Wallet and MyTonWallet extensions


A more reliable and private method is to use a browser extension that connects directly to the TON Proxy without relying on third-party services.
Currently:
- [MyTonWallet](https://mytonwallet.io/) supports TON Proxy in its browser extension. 
- [TON Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ton-wallet/nphplpgoakhhjchkkhmiggakijnkhfnd) will support it soon.

This method requires installing a browser extension and is suitable for regular use by most users.
