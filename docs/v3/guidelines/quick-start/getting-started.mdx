# Getting started

Welcome to TON quick start guide! This guide will give you a starting point for further research of TON concepts and basic practical experience of developing applications with the TON ecosystem.

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge.
- Around __30 minutes__ of your time.

> **Note**: We will provide a short explanation of core concepts during the guide, but if you prefer a more theoretical approach, you can check out core concepts of [TON blockchain](/v3/concepts/dive-into-ton/ton-blockchain/blockchain-of-blockchains) first.

## What You'll Learn

- Interact with TON ecosystem: Wallets and Explorers.
- Setup development environment: use Blueprint SDK for developing `smart-contracts` using `FunC`, `Tact`, and `Tolk` programming languages.
- Send transactions and read from the **blockchain** using your preferred programming language and available **SDKs**.
- Core concepts of **TON blockchain**: `messages`, `smart-contracts`, `addresses` and etc.
- Basic templates ready for implementation of your project logic.

## Concept of smart-contract

You can think of smart-contracts in TON as a program running on blockchain following well known behavior concept of [actor](/v3/concepts/dive-into-ton/ton-blockchain/blockchain-of-blockchains#single-actor). In contrast to some other blockchains where you can call in synchronous way other contracts code, smart-contract in TON is a thing in itself, and communicates with other smart-contracts on equal basis sending asynchronous messages between each other. Each processing of those queries by receiver smart-contract is considered a transaction resulting in following actions:
 - Sending further messages.
 - Changing internal data or even code of smart-contract itself.
 - Changing it's balance.

Available interfaces of smart-contract are:
 - Receiving **`internal messages`** from other smart-contract.
 - Receiving **`external messages`** from outside the blockchain.
 - Receiving **`get methods`** request from outside the blockchain.

In contrast to `internal` and `external` messages, `get methods` are not what you can consider as a **transaction**. Those are special functions of smart contract that cannot change contract internal state or proceed any other action except querying specific data from contract state. Contrary to what might seem intuitive, invoking `get methods` from other contracts **is not possible**, primarily due to the nature of blockchain technology and the need for consensus.

Hereinafter we will use terms `actor`, `smart-contract` and `account` interchangeably.

## Interacting with TON ecosystem

Before we step on our way of becoming a TON developer, we should become an advanced user of TON! Let's create your own `wallet`, send a few transactions, and see how our actions are reflected on the blockchain using `explorers`.

### Step 1: Create a new wallet using an app

The simplest way to create a `wallet` is to visit https://ton.org/wallets and choose one of the wallet apps from the list. This page explains the difference between **custodial** and **non-custodial** wallets. With a **non-custodial** wallet, you own the wallet and hold its **private key** by yourself. With a **custodial** wallet, you trust somebody else to do this for you. They are all pretty similar, let's choose [Tonkeeper](https://tonkeeper.com/). Go ahead, install and run it.

### Step 2: Mainnet and Testnet

In the TON, the `Mainnet` and `Testnet` have distinct roles. The `Mainnet` is the primary network where actual transactions take place, carrying real economic value as they involve real cryptocurrency and staked validators executing our transactions and guarantee a very high level of security. On the other hand, the `Testnet` is a testing version of the TON **blockchain** designed for development and testing purposes. Transactions on the `testnet` do not have real economic value, making it a risk-free zone for developers to test without financial implications. It's mainly used for development, testing `smart contracts`, and trying new features.

Since TON basic transactions are very cheap, about 1 cent per transaction, investing just $5 will be enough for hundreds of them. You can get TON coins by simply pressing the buy button in the user interface, or ask someone to send them to your `address`, which you can copy from the wallet app somewhere near your balance. Don't worry, sharing your `address` is **totally safe**, unless you don't want it to be associated with you.

### Step 3: Creating testnet wallet

If you decide to use the `Testnet` version instead, you can do to it by following guide below.

#### Generating mnemonic

To create your first testnet wallet in Tonkeeper you should obtain mnemonic using the button below. Do not forget to save this phrase!

<MnemonicGenerator />

#### Creating wallet

To create testnet wallet click *`Wallet`* -> *`Add Wallet`* - *`TestnetAccount`*. Then import seed phrase generated in previous step.

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', gap: '20px', flexWrap: 'wrap', marginBottom: '30px'}}>
  <br/>
  <ThemedImage
    height='600px'
    alt=""
    sources={{
      light: '/img/tutorials/quick-start/tonkeeper-light.jpg?raw=true',
      dark: '/img/tutorials/quick-start/tonkeeper-dark.jpg?raw=true',
    }}
  />
  <br/>
</div>

For the `Testnet` version, you can request funds from the [Testgiver Ton Bot](https://t.me/testgiver_ton_bot). After a short wait, you will receive 2 TONs that will appear in your wallet app.

### Step 4: Exploring the blockchain

Congratulations! We created our first wallet and received some funds on it. Now let's take a look at how our actions are reflected in the `blockchain`. We can do this by using various [explorers](https://ton.app/explorers). An explorer is a tool that allows you to query data from the chain, investigate TON `smart-contracts`, and transactions.

For our examples, we are going to use [TonViewer](https://tonviewer.com/). Note that in case of using `testnet`, you should manually change the explorer mode to the `testnet` version. Don't forget that these are different networks not sharing any transactions or `smart-contracts`, so your `testnet` wallet would not be visible in `mainnet` mode and vice versa.

Let's take a look at our newly created wallet using the explorer: copy your wallet address from the app and insert it into the search line of the explorer like this:

<div style={{marginBottom: '30px'}}>
  <img src="/img/tutorials/quick-start/explorer1.png" alt="Screenshot of explorer search interface"/>
</div>

At this moment, your address should be in the `uninit` or `nonexisting` state depending on whether you have already received funds or not. Like any other `smart-contract`, wallets in TON need to be deployed to the network, and since this process requires some amount of transaction fees - `gas` - most wallet apps don't actually deploy the wallet `smart-contract` until you receive funds on your address and try to make your first transaction.

<div style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>
  <img src="/img/tutorials/quick-start/nonexist.png" alt="Screenshot of nonexistent wallet state"/>
</div>
<div style={{marginBottom: '30px'}}>
  <img src="/img/tutorials/quick-start/uninit.png" alt="Screenshot of uninitialized wallet state"/>
</div>

As you can see, the `nonexisting` state is the default state for any address that has not been used before. `uninit` stands for an address that has some metadata such as funds, but hasn't been initialized by deployed `smart-contract` code or data.

Let's send our first transaction to someone special - **ourselves**. And see how it looks on the `blockchain`. Enter the send menu in your wallet app and transfer some funds to your own address that you have copied before. In the explorer, our contract should start looking something like this:

<div style={{marginBottom: '30px'}}>
  <img src="/img/tutorials/quick-start/active.png" alt="Screenshot of active wallet state"/>
</div>

And here we are, our wallet contract is deployed and ready to use. Let's examine provided user interface:

 - **Metadata** header: describes your smart-contract properties in blockchain context, usually consist of `Address`, `Balance` and address `State` that is, in our case is **Active**. The first thing that we could mention is, despite the fact that we sent funds to ourselves, the balance has still been decreased by a little bit. As was mentioned before, any transaction requires some fee called `gas` depending on the amount of computation required by `smart-contract` logic, sent messages, and stored data.

 - **History** and **Transactions** tab: consist of `transactions` history of your account providing short and more complex description of them respectively were you can see transactions performed by you during guide.

 - **Code** tab: showing raw data and code of your `smart-contract` generated by compiling its code on one of the programming languages: `Func`, `Tact` or `Tolk`. Note that, additionally, **Metadata** header is able to detect `Contract type` of contract, which is in our case - `wallet_v5r1`, by looking into smart-contract raw code and determine standard implementation of wallet.

 - **Methods** tab: provides execution of contract `get methods` implemented by developer usually used to retrieve `smart-contract` persistent data in convenient way from outside of the blockchain.

## Next Steps:

 - Try to experiment with `wallet app` and `wallet smart-contract`: create another wallet contract in your wallet app and try to send transactions between them.
 - Continue to [Blockchain interaction](/v3/guidelines/quick-start/blockchain-interaction/reading-from-network) if you want to learn how to interact with `smart-contracts` from outside the blockchain.
 - Or dive into [Developing smart-contracts](/v3/guidelines/quick-start/developing-smart-contracts/setup-environment) to learn how to develop `smart-contracts` by yourself!

**Happy creating on TON!**
