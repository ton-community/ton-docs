# Deploying to network

> **Summary:** In previous steps we developed and tested our smart contracts ensuring their correctness. 

In this part of the guide we will proceed to deployment of previously developed smart contracts and cover interaction with them on-chain.

## Address and initial state

We already know that [address](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/addresses/) is unique identifier of `smart contract` in network which is used to send transactions and verify their sender upon receive, but we still didn't discussed how it's created. The common formula of smart contract address looks like that:

***address=hash(state_init(code, data))***

Address of smart contract is a hash of aggregated initial code and data of smart contracts upon deployment. This simple mechanism have few important consequences:

### You already know the address

In TON any address that don't have any data is considered in `nonexistent` state, nevertheless when we created a wallet using wallet app in [Getting started](/v3/guidelines/quick-start/getting-started) section we still was able to get address of our **future** wallet smart contract from wallet app before it's deployment and examine it in explorer. 

The reason behind that is because creating your **private** and **public** key pair through **mnemonic phrase**, where second key is part of initial data of smart contract makes `state_init` of our contract fully determent:
 - **code** is one of the standard wallet implementation, like `v5r1`.
 - **data** is `public_key` with other default initialized fields.

Which makes it possible to calculate future wallet smart contract address.

### Magic storage member

In previous steps we deliberately didn't explain the purpose of `ctxID` and `ID` stored in our smart contracts state and remaining untouched in all smart contracts functionality. Now their purpose should start to be more clear.

Since we can't deploy smart contract with the same `state_init` the only way to provide same initial code and **"same"** initial data is to create separate filed in it ensuring additional uniqueness. Which in case of wallet gives you opportunity to have same key pair to several wallet smart contracts.

### One to rule them all

If you already considered that `ID` field is a must-have for any smart contract, there is another opportunity that could change your mind. Let's examine previously developed `CounterInternal` smart contract init section:

```tact
init(id: Int, owner: Address) {
    self.id = id;
    self.counter = 0;
    self.owner = owner;
}
```

If we remove `id` field from its initial storage we can ensure that **only one** `CounterInternal` smart-cotnract could exzist for a particular owner.

:::info Tokens
This mechanism plays cruicial role in [Jetton Processing](/v3/guidelines/dapps/asset-processing/jettons/), each non-native(jetton) token requires it's own `Jetton Wallet` for a particular owner and therefore provides a calculatable address from it, creating a **star scheme** with basic wallet in center.

## Implementation

Now, when our smart contracts is fully tested, we are ready to deploy them into the TON. In `Blueprint SDK` this process is the same for both `Mainnet` and `Testnet` and any of the presented languages in guide: `FunC`, `Tact`, `Tolk`. 

### Step 1: Update deployment script

Deploy scripts relays on the same wrappers that you have used in testing scripts, we will use one common script to deploy both of previously deployed smart contracts, update `deployHelloWorld.ts` with this code:

```typescript title="/scripts/deployHelloWorld.ts"
import { toNano } from '@ton/core';
import { HelloWorld } from '../wrappers/HelloWorld';
import { CounterInternal } from '../wrappers/CounterInternal';
import { compile, NetworkProvider } from '@ton/blueprint';

export async function run(provider: NetworkProvider) {
    const helloWorld = provider.open(
        HelloWorld.createFromConfig(
            {
                id: Math.floor(Math.random() * 10000),
                ctxCounter: 0,
                ctxCounterExt: 0n,
            },
            await compile('HelloWorld')
        )
    );

    await helloWorld.sendDeploy(provider.sender(), toNano('0.05'));

    await provider.waitForDeploy(helloWorld.address);

    const counterInternal = provider.open(
        await CounterInternal.fromInit(
            BigInt(Math.floor(Math.random() * 10000)),
            helloWorld.address
        )
    );

    await counterInternal.send(
        provider.sender(),
        { value: toNano('0.05') }, 
        null
    );

    await provider.waitForDeploy(counterInternal.address);

    console.log('ID', await helloWorld.getID());
    console.log('ID', (await counterInternal.getId()).toString());
}
```

### Step 2: Run deploy script

You can run scripts by entering following command:

```bash
npx blueprint run # deployHelloWorld # optionally directly pass script
```

### Step 3: choose network

After that you will see interactive menu allowing to choose network:

```bash
? Which network do you want to use? (Use arrow keys)
  mainnet
❯ testnet
  custom
```

:::danger
Before deployment to the `Mainnet` ensure that your smart contracts correspond to [Security Measures](/v3/guidelines/smart-contracts/security/overview/), as we sad before, `HelloWorld` smart contract **don't**.
:::

### Step 4: choose wallet app

Next, choose the way to access your wallet, the easiest way to do that is using [TON Connect](/v3/guidelines/ton-connect/overview/) for most popular wallet apps: `TonKeeper`, `MyTonWallet` or `Tonhub`.
```bash
? Which wallet are you using? (Use arrow keys)
❯ TON Connect compatible mobile wallet (example: Tonkeeper) 
  Create a ton:// deep link 
  Mnemonic

? Choose your wallet (Use arrow keys)
❯ Tonkeeper 
  MyTonWallet 
  Tonhub
```

Finally scan QR code in the terminal through your wallet app and connect the wallet. After you done that for the first time in project this step will be skipped.

You will recieve a transaction request in your wallet app each time your code require currency for transaction.

### Step 5: observe your smart contract in network

 After confirming request in your wallet and awaiting for deployment you will see corresponding message with the reference to your newly deployed smart contract view in explorer:

```bash
Contract deployed at address EQBrFHgzSwxVYBXjIYAM6g2RHbeFebJA8QUDwg4IX8CPDPug
You can view it at https://testnet.tonscan.org/address/EQBrFHgzSwxVYBXjIYAM6g2RHbeFebJA8QUDwg4IX8CPDPug
```

**Congratulations!** Your custom `smart contracts` is ready to execute `get methods` same way as your wallet in [Getting started](/v3/guidelines/quick-start/getting-started#navigation-tabs/) section and execute `transactions` same as in [Blockchain Interaction](/v3/guidelines/quick-start/blockchain-interaction/reading-from-network) section - consider it's reading to understand how to interact with `smart contracts` off-chain if you still don't.

:::tip
Using `Blueprint SDK` and wallet apps is not the only option, you can create message with [state_init](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/message-management/sending-messages#message-layout/) by yourself, moreover you can do it even through smart contract [internal message](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/message-management/sending-messages#message-layout/).
