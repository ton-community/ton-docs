# Processing Messages

> **Summary:** In previous steps we modified our smart-contract interaction with `storage, `get methods` and learned basic smart-contract development flow.

Now that we have learned basic examples of modifying smart-contract code and using development tools, we are ready to move on to the main functionality of smart contracts - sending and receiving messages.

First thing to mention is that in TON, messages are not just currency exchange actions carrying TON coins. They are also a **data exchange mechanism** that provides an opportunity to create your own "network" of smart contracts interacting with each other and smart contracts of other network participants that are not under your direct control.

---

## Internal messages

We are almost at the finish line! Let's cook a simple `internal message` to other contract and implement its processing on receiver side! We have already seen a counter that increases its values through `external messages`, now let's make it through internal one. And to make this task a little more interesting let's ensure that only one `actor` has access to this functionality.

### Actors and roles

Since TON implements actor [model](/v3/concepts/dive-into-ton/ton-blockchain/blockchain-of-blockchains/#single-actor) it's natural to think about smart-contracts relations in terms of `roles`, determining who can access smart-contract functionality or not. The most common examples of roles are:

 - `anyone`: any contract that don't have distinct role.
 - `owner`: contract that has exclusive access to some crucial parts of functionality.

If you look at `recv_internal()` function signature in your smart contract you can see `in_msg_full` and `in_msg_body` arguments, while the second one carries actual payload of sender which is free to fill it anyway they want, first one consists of several values describing transaction context. You can consider `in_msg_full` as some type of message **header**. We will not dwell in detail for each of values during this guide, what is important for us now, is that this part of message is defined by TON implementation and **always validated on sender side** and as a result cannot be fabricated.

What we specifically are interested in is the source address of message, by obtaining that address and comparing to stored one, that we previously saved, for example, during deployment, we can open crucial part of our smart contract functionality. Common approach looks like this:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="FunC" label="FunC">
```func
;; This is NOT a part of the project, just an example.
() recv_internal(int my_balance, int msg_value, cell in_msg_full, slice in_msg_body) impure {
    ;; Parse the sender address from in_msg_full
    slice cs = in_msg_full.begin_parse();
    int flags = cs~load_uint(4);
    slice sender_address = cs~load_msg_addr();

    ;; check if message was send by owner
    if (equal_slices(sender_address, owner_address)) {
      ;;owner operations
      return
    } else if (equal_slices(sender_address, other_role_address)){
      ;;other role operations
      return
    } else {
      ;;anyone else operations
      return
    }

    ;;no known operation were obtained for presented role
    ;;0xffff is not standard exit code, but is standard practice among TON developers
    throw(0xffff);
}
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Tolk" label="Tolk">
```tolk
// This is NOT a part of the project, just an example.
fun onInternalMessage(myBalance: int, msgValue: int, msgFull: cell, msgBody: slice) {
    // Parse the sender address from in_msg_full
    var cs: slice = msgFull.beginParse();
    val flags = cs.loadMessageFlags();
    var sender_address = cs~load_msg_address();

    if (isSliceBitsEqual(sender_address, owner_address)) {
      // owner operations
      return
    } else if (isSliceBitsEqual(sender_address, other_role_address)){
      // other role operations
      return
    } else {
      // anyone else operations
      return
    }

    throw 0xffff; // if the message contains an op that is not known to this contract, we throw
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Operations

Another common pattern in TON contracts is to include a **32-bit operation code** in message bodies which tells your contract what action to perform:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="FunC" label="FunC">
```func
;; This is NOT a part of the project, just an example!
const int op::increment = 1;
const int op::decrement = 2;

() recv_internal(int my_balance, int msg_value, cell in_msg_full, slice in_msg_body) impure {
    ;; Step 1: Check if the message is empty
    if (in_msg_body.slice_empty?()) {
        return; ;; Nothing to do with empty messages
    }

    ;; Step 2: Extract the operation code
    int op = in_msg_body~load_uint(32);

    ;; Step 3-7: Handle the requested operation
    if (op == op::increment) {
        increment();   ;;call to specific operation handler
        return;
    } else if (op == op::decrement) {
        decrement();
        ;; Just accept the money
        return;
    }

    ;; Unknown operation
    throw(0xffff);
}
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Tolk" label="Tolk">
```tolk
//This is NOT a part of the project, just an example!
const op::increment : int = 1;
const op::decrement : int = 2;

fun onInternalMessage(myBalance: int, msgValue: int, msgFull: cell, msgBody: slice) {
    // Step 1: Check if the message is empty
    if (slice.isEndOfSlice()) {
        return; // Nothing to do with empty messages
    }

    // Step 2: Extract the operation code
    var op = in_msg_body~load_uint(32);

    // Step 3-7: Handle the requested operation
    if (op == op::increment) {
        increment();   //call to specific operation handler
        return;
    } else if (op == op::decrement) {
        decrement();
        // Just accept the money
        return;
    }

    // Unknown operation
    throw(0xffff);
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

By combining both of these patterns you can achieve a comprehensive description of your smart-contract's systems ensuring secure interaction between them and unleash full potential of TON actors model.

## Implementation in Tact

Tact is a high-level programming language for the TON Blockchain, focused on efficiency and simplicity. It is designed to be easy to learn and use while being well-suited for smart contract development. Tact is a statically typed language with a simple syntax and a powerful type system.

:::info
For more details, refer to the [Tact documentation](https://docs.tact-lang.org/#start) and [Tact By Example](https://tact-by-example.org/00-hello-world).
:::

Let's create and modify our smart-contract folowing standard steps decsribed in previous [Blueprint SDK overview](/v3/guidelines/quick-start/developing-smart-contracts/blueprint-sdk-overview) section.

### Step 1: Creating and modifying Tact contract

First, let's create Tact contract.

```bash
npx blueprint create CounterInternal --type tact-counter
```

Resulted project structure should look like this:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="FunC" label="FunC">
```ls title="Project structure"
Example/
├─ contracts/                  # Smart contract source code

```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Tolk" label="Tolk">
```ls title="Project structure"

   ├─ HelloWorld.compile.ts       # Compilation configuration
   └─ HelloWorld.ts               # Wrapper for HelloWorld contract
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

At the top of the generated contract file: `counter_internal.tolk`, you may see a [message](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/structs-and-messages/) definition:

```tact
message Add {
    queryId: Int as uint64;
    amount: Int as uint32;
}
```

A message is a basic structure for communication between contracts. Tact automatically serializes and deserializes messages into cells. To ensure that opcodes will be the same during message structure changes, it may be added like below:

```tact
message(0x7e8764ef) Add {
    queryId: Int as uint64;
    amount: Int as uint32;
}
```

Tact will serialize it as follows:

```func
begin_cell()
    .store_uint(0x7e8764ef, 32) ;; message opcode
    .store_uint(query_id, 64)
    .store_uint(amount, 32)
    .end_cell()
```

Using this structure, a message can be sent to the contract from FunC.

#### Defining the contract

The [contract](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/contracts/) definition in Tact follows an object-oriented programming style:

```tact
contract CounterInternal {
    ...
}
```

#### Contract storage

A contract may store its state variables as follows. They may be accessed with [`Self reference`](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/contracts/#self)

```tact
id: Int as uint32;
counter: Int as uint32;
```

To ensure that only the contract owner can interact with specific functions, add an `owner` field:

```tact
id: Int as uint32;
counter: Int as uint32;
owner: Address;
```

These fields are serialized similarly to structures and stored in the contract's data register.

#### Initializing the contract

If you compile the contract at this stage, you will encounter the error: `Field "owner" is not set`. This is because the contract needs to initialize its fields upon deployment. Define an [`init()`](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/contracts/#init-function) function to do this:

```tact
init(id: Int, owner: Address) {
    self.id = id;
    self.counter = 0;
    self.owner = owner;
}
```

#### Handling messages

To accept messages from other contracts, use a [receiver](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/functions/#receiver-functions) function. Receiver functions automatically match the message's opcode and invoke the corresponding function:

```tact
receive(msg: Add) {
    self.counter += msg.amount;
    self.notify("Cashback".asComment());
}
```

#### Restricting access

To ensure that only the contract owner can send messages, use the `require` function:

```tact
receive(msg: Add) {
    // `sender()` function is used to retrieve message sender address
    require(sender() == self.owner, "Not owner!");
    self.counter += msg.amount;
    self.notify("Cashback".asComment());
}
```

:::info
[Identity validation](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/security-best-practices/#identity-validation) plays a key role in secure contract interactions. You can read more about identity validation and its importance in the linked documentation.
:::

Tact also provides handy ways to share same logic through [traits](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/types/#traits). Use the `Ownable` trait, which provides built-in ownership checks:

```tact
// Import library to use trait
import "@stdlib/ownable";

// Ownable trait introduced here
contract CounterInternal1 with Ownable {

    ...

    receive(msg: Add) {
        // require(sender() == self.owner, "Not owner!");
        // instead of requiring owner self.requireOwner() may be used
        self.requireOwner();
        self.counter += msg.amount;
        self.notify("Cashback".asComment());
    }
}
```

#### Getter functions

Tact supports [getter functions](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/functions/#getter-functions) for retrieving contract state off-chain:

:::note
Get function cannot be called from another contract.
:::

```tact
get fun counter(): Int {
    return self.counter;
}

slice get_owner() method_id {
    load_data();
    return owner_address;
}
```

Note, that the `owner` getter is automatically defined via the `Ownable` trait.

#### Complete contract

```tact title="CounterInternal.tact"
import "@stdlib/deploy";
import "@stdlib/ownable";

// message with opcode
message(0x7e8764ef) Add {
    queryId: Int as uint64;
    amount: Int as uint32;
}

// Contract defenition. `Ownable` is a trait to share functionality, `Deployable` used to deploy contract
contract CounterInternal with Deployable, Ownable {

    // storage variables
    id: Int as uint32;
    counter: Int as uint32;
    owner: Address;

    // init function.
    init(id: Int, owner: Address) {
        self.id = id;
        self.counter = 0;
        self.owner = owner;
    }

    // function to recive messages from other contracts
    receive(msg: Add) {
        // function from `Ownable` trait to assert, that only owner may call this
        self.requireOwner();
        self.counter += msg.amount;

        // Notify the caller that the receiver was executed and forward remaining value back
        self.notify("Cashback".asComment());
    }

    // getter function to be called offchain
    get fun counter(): Int {
        return self.counter;
    }

    get fun id(): Int {
        return self.id;
    }
}
```

Verify that smart-contract code is correct by running build script:

```bash
npm blueprint build 
```

### Step 2: Using contract wrappers

[Wrappers](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/compile/#wrap-ts) facilitate contract interaction from TypeScript. Unlike in FunC or Tolk, they are generated automatically during the build process:

```typescript ./wrappers/CounterInternal.ts
export * from '../build/CounterInternal/tact_CounterInternal';
```

### Step 3: Updating tests

Now let's ensure that our smart-contract failes if non-owner tries to increment smart-contract by adding this test:

```typescript title="tests/CounterInternal.spec.ts"
import { Blockchain, SandboxContract, TreasuryContract} from '@ton/sandbox';
import { Cell, toNano } from '@ton/core';
import { CounterInternal } from '../wrappers/CounterInternal';
import '@ton/test-utils';
import { compile } from '@ton/blueprint';

describe('CounterInternal', () => {
    let codeHelloWorld: Cell;
    let blockchain: Blockchain;
    let counterInternal: SandboxContract<CounterInternal>;
    let deployerCounter: SandboxContract<TreasuryContract>;

    beforeAll(async () => {
        codeHelloWorld = await compile('HelloWorld');
    });

    beforeEach(async () => {
        blockchain = await Blockchain.create();

        deployerCounter = await blockchain.treasury('deployerCounter');

        // Deploy CounterInternal with HelloWorld as the owner
        counterInternal = blockchain.openContract(
            await CounterInternal.fromInit(0n, deployerCounter.address)
        );

        const deployResultCounter = await counterInternal.send(deployerCounter.getSender(), { value: toNano('1.00') }, {
            $$type: 'Deploy',
            queryId: 0n
        });

        expect(deployResultCounter.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
            from: deployerCounter.address,
            to: counterInternal.address,
            deploy: true,
            success: true
        });
    });

    it('should fail if not owner call increment', async () => {
        // Verify owner is correctly set to HelloWorld
        const ownerAddress = await counterInternal.getOwner();
        expect(ownerAddress.equals(deployerCounter.address)).toBe(true);

        // Get initial counter value
        const counterBefore = await counterInternal.getCounter();

        // Try to increase counter from a non-owner account (should fail)
        const nonOwner = await blockchain.treasury('nonOwner');
        const increaseBy = 5n;

        const nonOwnerResult = await counterInternal.send(nonOwner.getSender(), {
            value: toNano('0.05')
        }, {
            $$type: 'Add',
            amount: increaseBy,
            queryId: 0n
        });

        // This should fail since only the owner should be able to increment
        expect(nonOwnerResult.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
            from: nonOwner.address,
            to: counterInternal.address,
            success: false,
            exitCode: 132 // The error code thrown in the contract, Access Denied
        });

        // Counter should remain unchanged
        const counterAfterNonOwner = await counterInternal.getCounter();
        expect(counterAfterNonOwner).toBe(counterBefore);
    });
});

```

## External Messages

`External messages` are your only way of toggling smart contract logic from outside the blockchain. Usually, there is no need for implementation of them in smart contracts because in most cases you don't want external entry points to be accessible to anyone except you. If this is all functionality that you want from external section - standard way is to delegate this responsibility to separate actor - [wallet](v3/documentation/smart-contracts/contracts-specs/wallet-contracts#basic-wallets) which is practically the main reason they were designed for.

Developing external endpoint includes several standard [approuches](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/message-management/external-messages) and [security measures](/v3/guidelines/smart-contracts/security/overview) that might be overwhelming at this point. Therefore in this guide we will realize incrementing previously added to `hello_world` contract `ctxCounterExt` number and add send message to out `Tact` contract.

:::danger
This implementation is **unsafe** and may lead to loosing your contract funds. Don't deploy it to `mainnet`, especially with high smart-contract balance.
:::

## Implementation

Let's modify our smart-contract to recieve external messages and send increase counter to another contract folowing standard steps decsribed in previous [Blueprint SDK overview](/v3/guidelines/quick-start/developing-smart-contracts/blueprint-sdk-overview).

### Step1 : Edit smart-contract code

Add `recv_external` function to `HelloWorld` smart-contract:

```func title="HelloWorld.fc"
() recv_external(slice in_msg) impure {
    accept_message();

    var (ctx_id, ctx_counter, ctx_counter_ext) = load_data();

    var query_id = in_msg~load_uint(64);
    var addr = in_msg~load_msg_addr();
    var coins = in_msg~load_coins();
    var increase_by = in_msg~load_uint(32);

    var msg = begin_cell()
        .store_uint(0x18, 6)
        .store_slice(addr)
        .store_coins(coins)
        .store_uint(0, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1)
        .store_uint(op::increase, 32)
        .store_uint(query_id, 64)
        .store_uint(increase_by, 32);
    send_raw_message(msg.end_cell(), 0);

    ctx_counter_ext += increase_by;
    save_data(ctx_id, ctx_counter, ctx_counter_ext);

    return ();
}
```

Verify that smart-contract code is correct by running:

```bash
npm blueprint build
```

### Step 2: Update Wrapper 

And add wrapper method to call it through our wrapper class for sending external message:

```typescript
async sendExternalIncrease(
    provider: ContractProvider,
    opts: {
        increaseBy: number;
        value: bigint;
        addr: Address;
        queryID?: number;
    }
) {
    const message = beginCell()
        .storeUint(opts.queryID ?? 0, 64)
        .storeAddress(opts.addr)
        .storeCoins(opts.value)
        .storeUint(opts.increaseBy, 32)
    .endCell()

    return await provider.external(message);
}
```

### Step 3: Update test

Update test to esnure that `HelloWorld` contract recieved internal message, sended internal message to `CounterInternal` contract and both updated their counters:

```typescript title="HelloWorld.spec.ts"
import { Blockchain, SandboxContract, TreasuryContract } from '@ton/sandbox';
import { Cell, toNano} from '@ton/core';
import { HelloWorld } from '../wrappers/HelloWorld';
import '@ton/test-utils';
import { compile } from '@ton/blueprint';

describe('HelloWorld', () => {
    let code: Cell;

    beforeAll(async () => {
        code = await compile('HelloWorld');
    });

    let blockchain: Blockchain;
    let deployer: SandboxContract<TreasuryContract>;
    let helloWorld: SandboxContract<HelloWorld>;

    beforeEach(async () => {
        blockchain = await Blockchain.create();

        helloWorld = blockchain.openContract(
            HelloWorld.createFromConfig(
                {
                    id: 0,
                    ctxCounter: 0,
                    ctxCounterExt: 0n,
                },
                code
            )
        );

        deployer = await blockchain.treasury('deployer');

        const deployResult = await helloWorld.sendDeploy(deployer.getSender(), toNano('1.00'));

        expect(deployResult.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
            from: deployer.address,
            to: helloWorld.address,
            deploy: true,
            success: true,
        });
    });

    it('should deploy', async () => {
        // the check is done inside beforeEach
        // blockchain and helloWorld are ready to use
    });

    it('should send an external message and update counter', async () => {
        const receiver = await blockchain.treasury('receiver');

        const receiverBalanceBefore = await receiver.getBalance();
        const [__, counterExtBefore] = await helloWorld.getCounters()
        const increase = 5;

        const result = await helloWorld.sendExternalIncrease({
            increaseBy: increase,
            value: toNano(0.05),
            addr: receiver.address,
            queryID: 0
        });

        expect(result.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
            from: undefined, // External messages have no 'from' address
            to: helloWorld.address,
            success: true,
        });

        expect(result.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
            from: helloWorld.address,
            to: receiver.address,
            success: true,
        });

        const receiverBalanceAfter = await receiver.getBalance();

        expect(receiverBalanceAfter).toBeGreaterThan(receiverBalanceBefore);
        const [_, counterExt] = await helloWorld.getCounters()
        expect(counterExtBefore + BigInt(increase)).toBe(counterExt);
    });
});
```

Verify that all examples is correct by running test script:

```bash
npm blueprint test
```

Congratulations! You have successfully created a **multi-contract** system and learned how to handle **internal** and **external** messages. This example illustrates the typical flow of any message chain: sending an `external message`, triggering the `internal messages` flow based on your system model, and so on. Now that our contracts have been fully tested, we are ready to deploy them and interact with them on-chain.
