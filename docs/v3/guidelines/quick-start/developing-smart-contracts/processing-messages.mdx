# Processing Messages

> **Summary:** In previous steps we modified our smart-contract interaction with `storage, `get methods` and learned basic smart-contract development flow.

Now that we have learned basic examples of modifying smart-contract code and using development tools, we are ready to move on to the main functionality of smart contracts - sending and receiving messages.

First thing to mention is that in TON, messages are not just currency exchange actions carrying TON coins. They are also a **data exchange mechanism** that provides an opportunity to create your own "network" of smart contracts interacting with each other and smart contracts of other network participants that are not under your direct control.

## External Messages

`External messages` are your main way of toggling smart contract logic from outside the blockchain. Usually, there is no need for implementation of them in smart contracts because in most cases you don't want external entry points to be accessible to anyone except you. This includes several standard approaches of verifying external message sender providing safe entry point to the TON network which we will discuss here. If this is all functionality that you want from external section - standard way is to delegate this responsibility to separate actor - `wallet` which is practically the main reason they were designed for.

### Wallets

When we sent coins using wallet app in [getting started](/v3/guidelines/quick-start/getting-started#step-3-exploring-the-blockchain) section what `wallet app` actually performs is sending `external message` to your `wallet` smart contract which performs sending message to destination smart-contract address that you wrote in send menu. While most wallet apps during creation of wallet deploy most modern versions of wallet smart contracts - `v5`, providing more complex functionality, let's examine `recv_external` section of more basic one - `v3`:

```func
() recv_external(slice in_msg) impure {
    var signature = in_msg~load_bits(512);
    var cs = in_msg;
    var (subwallet_id, msg_seqno) = (cs~load_uint(32), cs~load_uint(32));
    var ds = get_data().begin_parse();
    var (stored_seqno, stored_subwallet, public_key) = (ds~load_uint(32), ds~load_uint(32), ds~load_uint(256));
    ds.end_parse();
    throw_unless(33, msg_seqno == stored_seqno);
    throw_unless(34, subwallet_id == stored_subwallet);
    throw_unless(35, check_signature(slice_hash(in_msg), signature, public_key));
    accept_message();
    cs~touch();
    while (cs.slice_refs()) {
        var mode = cs~load_uint(8);
        send_raw_message(cs~load_ref(), mode);
    }
    set_data(begin_cell()
        .store_uint(stored_seqno + 1, 32)
        .store_uint(stored_subwallet, 32)
        .store_uint(public_key, 256)
    .end_cell());
    }
```

First thing to mention - is `signature` in message body and stored `public_key`. This refers to standard mechanism of asymmetric cryptography: during deployment process you create **private and public key pair**, store the second one in initial contract storage and then during sending external message through client **sign** it with **private key** attaching calculated `signature` to message body. Smart contract on its side checks if signature matches `public_key` and accepts external message if it is so.

Standard signature system for TON smart-contracts is `Ed25519` which is directly provided by `TVM` instruction `check_signature()`, but you can always implement another preferred algorithm by yourself.

:::tip
When you entered **magic 24 secret words** (i.e. **mnemonic phrase**) during [wallet creation](/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/tl-b-language) in your app what is practically performed is concatenation of those words into one string and hashing it to create your **private key**. So remember not to show them to anyone.
:::

Second thing is `seqno` (sequential number) as you can see this is practically just a counter that increments each time wallet smart-contract receives external message, but why do we need one?
The reason behind that lies in blockchain nature: since all transactions are visible to anyone, potential malefactor could repeatedly send already signed transaction to your smart contract.

> **Simpliest scenario:** you transfer some amount of funds to receiver, receiver examines transaction and sends it to your contract repeatedly until you run out of funds and receiver gains almost all of them.

Third thing is `subwallet_id` that just checks equality to the stored one, we will discuss its meaning a little bit later in internal messages section.

### Implementation

At this point reasons behind changes that we made to our counter in previous storage and get methods [section](/v3/guidelines/quick-start/developing-smart-contracts/storage-and-get-methods#smart-contract-storage-operations) should start to be more clear! We already prepared our storage to contain `seqno`, `public_key` and `ctx_id` which will serve same task as `subwallet_id` so let's adapt wallet's `recv_external` function to our project:

```func
() recv_external(slice in_msg) impure {
    ;; retrives validating data from message body
    var signature = in_msg~load_bits(512);
    var cs = in_msg;
    var (ctx_id, msg_seqno) = (cs~load_uint(32), cs~load_uint(32));

    ;; retrieves stored data for validation checks
    var (stored_id, stored_seqno, public_key) = load_data();
    ;; replay protection mechanism through seqno chack and incrementing
    throw_unless(33, msg_seqno == stored_seqno);
    ;; id field for multiply addresess with same private_key
    throw_unless(34, ctx_id == stored_id);
    ;; ed25519 signature check
    throw_unless(35, check_signature(slice_hash(in_msg), signature, public_key));
    ;; accepting message after all checks
    accept_message();
    ;; optimization technique
    ;; putting message body to stack head
    cs~touch();
    ;; sending serialized on client side messages
    while (cs.slice_refs()) {
        var mode = cs~load_uint(8);
        send_raw_message(cs~load_ref(), mode);
    }
    save_data(stored_id, stored_seqno + 1, public_key);
}
```

And add wrapper method to call it through our wrapper class:

```typescript
async function sendExternal(
    provider: ContractProvider,
    opts: {
        mode: number
        message: Cell,
        secret_key: Buffer
    }
) {
    const seqno = await this.getCounter(provider)
    const id = await this.getID(provider)

    const toSign = beginCell()
        .storeUint(id, 32)
        .storeUint(seqno, 32)
        .storeUint(opts.mode, 8)
        .storeRef(opts.message)

    const signature = sign(toSign.endCell().hash(), opts.secret_key)

    return await provider.external(beginCell()
        .storeBuffer(signature)
        .storeBuilder(toSign)
    .endCell()
    );
}
```

Here we are preparing all required values for contract checks and add payload message that will be sent as internal message further to final receiver smart-contract.

As you can see here we are using `provider.external()` method instead of `provider.internal()` one which requires a via argument, that now we can start to understand. The thing is that `provider.internal()` method is doing practically the same thing that we are trying to implement: since we can't directly call internal methods to test them we need to wrap them into external message and send it through some wallet.

Now let's test our implementation:

```typescript
it('should send an external message containing an internal message', async () => {
    const receiver = await blockchain.treasury('receiver');

    const internalMessage = beginCell()
        .storeUint(0, 32) // Simple message with no specific opcode
        .storeUint(42, 64) // queryID = 42
        .storeStringTail('Hello from external message!')
        .endCell();

    const messageToSend = beginCell().store(storeMessageRelaxed(internal({
        to: receiver.address,
        value: toNano(0.01),
        body: internalMessage,
        bounce: true,
    }))).endCell();

    const receiverBalanceBefore = await receiver.getBalance();

    const result = await helloWorld.sendExternal({
        mode: SendMode.PAY_GAS_SEPARATELY,
        message: messageToSend,
        secret_key: keyPair.secretKey
    });

    expect(result.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
        from: undefined, // External messages have no 'from' address
        to: helloWorld.address,
        success: true,
    });

    expect(result.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
        from: helloWorld.address,
        to: receiver.address,
        success: true,
    });

    const receiverBalanceAfter = await receiver.getBalance();

    expect(receiverBalanceAfter).toBeGreaterThan(receiverBalanceBefore);
    const [seqnoAfter] = await helloWorld.getSeqnoPKey();
    expect(seqnoAfter).toBe(1); // Since it should start from 0 and increment to 1
});
```

---

## Internal messages

We are almost at the finish line! Let's cook a simple `internal message` to other contract and implement its processing on receiver side! We have already seen a counter that increases its values through `external messages`, now let's make it through internal one. And to make this task a little more interesting let's ensure that only one `actor` has access to this functionality.

### Actors and roles

Since TON implements actor [model](/v3/concepts/dive-into-ton/ton-blockchain/blockchain-of-blockchains/#single-actor) it's natural to think about smart-contracts relations in terms of `roles`, determining who can access smart-contract functionality or not. The most common examples of roles are:

 - `anyone`: any contract that don't have distinct role.
 - `owner`: contract that has exclusive access to some crucial parts of functionality.

If you look at `recv_internal()` function signature in your smart contract you can see `in_msg_full` and `in_msg_body` arguments, while the second one carries actual payload of sender which is free to fill it anyway they want, first one consists of several values describing transaction context. You can consider `in_msg_full` as some type of message **header**. We will not dwell in detail for each of values during this guide, what is important for us now, is that this part of message is defined by TON implementation and **always validated on sender side** and as a result cannot be fabricated.

What we specifically are interested in is the source address of message, by obtaining that address and comparing to stored one, that we previously saved, for example, during deployment, we can open crucial part of our smart contract functionality. Common approach looks like this:

```func
() recv_internal(int my_balance, int msg_value, cell in_msg_full, slice in_msg_body) impure {
    ;; Parse the sender address from in_msg_full
    slice cs = in_msg_full.begin_parse();
    int flags = cs~load_uint(4);
    slice sender_address = cs~load_msg_addr();

    ;; Check if message was sent by the owner
    if (equal_slices(sender_address, owner_address)) {
      ;;owner operations
      return ();
    } else if (equal_slices(sender_address, other_role_address)){
      ;;other role operations
      return ();
    } else {
      ;;anyone else operations
      return ();
    }

    ;;no known operation were obtained for presented role
    ;;0xffff is not standard exit code, but is standard practice among TON developers
    throw(0xffff);
}
```

### Operations

Another common pattern in TON contracts is to include a **32-bit operation code** in message bodies which tells your contract what action to perform:

```func
const int op::increment = 1;
const int op::decrement = 2;

() recv_internal(int my_balance, int msg_value, cell in_msg_full, slice in_msg_body) impure {
    ;; Step 1: Check if the message is empty
    if (in_msg_body.slice_empty?()) {
        return; ;; Nothing to do with empty messages
    }

    ;; Step 2: Extract the operation code
    int op = in_msg_body~load_uint(32);

    ;; Step 3-7: Handle the requested operation
    if (op == op::increment) {
        increment();   ;;call to specific operation handler
        return;
    } else if (op == op::decrement) {
        decrement();
        ;; Just accept the money
        return;
    }

    ;; Unknown operation
    throw(0xffff);
}
```

By combining both of these patterns you can achieve a comprehensive description of your smart-contract's systems ensuring secure interaction between them and unleash full potential of TON actors model.

### Implementation in Tact

Tact is a high-level programming language for the TON Blockchain, focused on efficiency and simplicity. It is designed to be easy to learn and use while being well-suited for smart contract development. Tact is a statically typed language with a simple syntax and a powerful type system.

:::info
For more details, refer to the [Tact documentation](https://docs.tact-lang.org/#start) and [Tact By Example](https://tact-by-example.org/00-hello-world).
:::

#### Creating a Tact contract

First, let's create Tact contract.

```bash
npx blueprint create CounterInternal --type tact-counter
```

At the top of the generated contract file, you may see a [message](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/structs-and-messages/) definition:

```tact
message Add {
    queryId: Int as uint64;
    amount: Int as uint32;
}
```

A message is a basic structure for communication between contracts. Tact automatically serializes and deserializes messages into cells. To ensure that opcodes will be the same during message structure changes, it may be added like below:

```tact
message(0x7e8764ef) Add {
    queryId: Int as uint64;
    amount: Int as uint32;
}
```

Tact will serialize it as follows:

```func
begin_cell()
    .store_uint(0x7e8764ef, 32) ;; message opcode
    .store_uint(query_id, 64)
    .store_uint(amount, 32)
    .end_cell()
```

Using this structure, a message can be sent to the contract from FunC.

#### Defining the contract

The [contract](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/contracts/) definition in Tact follows an object-oriented programming style:

```tact
contract CounterInternal {
    ...
}
```

#### Contract storage

A contract may store its state variables as follows. They may be accessed with [`Self reference{:tact}`](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/contracts/#self)

```tact
id: Int as uint32;
counter: Int as uint32;
```

To ensure that only the contract owner can interact with specific functions, add an `owner` field:

```tact
id: Int as uint32;
counter: Int as uint32;
owner: Address;
```

These fields are serialized similarly to structures and stored in the contract's data register.

### Initializing the contract

If you compile the contract at this stage, you will encounter the error: `Field "owner" is not set`. This is because the contract needs to initialize its fields upon deployment. Define an [`init()`](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/contracts/#init-function) function to do this:

```tact
init(id: Int, owner: Address) {
    self.id = id;
    self.counter = 0;
    self.owner = owner;
}
```

#### Handling messages

To accept messages from other contracts, use a [receiver](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/functions/#receiver-functions) function. Receiver functions automatically match the message's opcode and invoke the corresponding function:

```tact
receive(msg: Add) {
    self.counter += msg.amount;
    self.notify("Cashback".asComment());
}
```

#### Restricting access

To ensure that only the contract owner can send messages, use the `require` function:

```tact
receive(msg: Add) {
    // `sender()` function is used to retrieve message sender address
    require(sender() == self.owner, "Not owner!");
    self.counter += msg.amount;
    self.notify("Cashback".asComment());
}
```

:::info
[Identity validation](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/security-best-practices/#identity-validation) plays a key role in secure contract interactions. You can read more about identity validation and its importance in the linked documentation.
:::

Tact also provides handy ways to share same logic through [traits](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/types/#traits). Use the `Ownable{:tact}` trait, which provides built-in ownership checks:

```tact
// Import library to use trait
import "@stdlib/ownable";

// Ownable trait introduced here
contract CounterInternal1 with Ownable {

    ...

    receive(msg: Add) {
        // require(sender() == self.owner, "Not owner!");
        // instead of requiring owner self.requireOwner() may be used
        self.requireOwner();
        self.counter += msg.amount;
        self.notify("Cashback".asComment());
    }
}
```

#### Getter functions

Tact supports [getter functions](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/functions/#getter-functions) for retrieving contract state off-chain:

:::note
Get function cannot be called from another contract.
:::

```tact
get fun counter(): Int {
    return self.counter;
}

get fun id(): Int {
    return self.id;
}
```

Note, that the `owner{:tact}` getter is automatically defined via the `Ownable{:tact}` trait.

#### Complete contract

```tact
import "@stdlib/deploy";
import "@stdlib/ownable";

// message with opcode
message(0x7e8764ef) Add {
    queryId: Int as uint64;
    amount: Int as uint32;
}

// Contract defenition. `Ownable` is a trait to share functionality, `Deployable` used to deploy contract
contract CounterInternal with Deployable, Ownable {

    // storage variables
    id: Int as uint32;
    counter: Int as uint32;
    owner: Address;

    // init function.
    init(id: Int, owner: Address) {
        self.id = id;
        self.counter = 0;
        self.owner = owner;
    }

    // function to recive messages from other contracts
    receive(msg: Add) {
        // function from `Ownable` trait to assert, that only owner may call this
        self.requireOwner();
        self.counter += msg.amount;

        // Notify the caller that the receiver was executed and forward remaining value back
        self.notify("Cashback".asComment());
    }

    // getter function to be called offchain
    get fun counter(): Int {
        return self.counter;
    }

    get fun id(): Int {
        return self.id;
    }
}
```

#### Using contract wrappers

[Wrappers](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/compile/#wrap-ts) facilitate contract interaction from TypeScript. Unlike in FunC or Tolk, they are generated automatically during the build process:

```typescript ./wrappers/CounterInternal.ts
export * from '../build/CounterInternal/tact_CounterInternal';
```

#### Testing the multi-contract system

The following test case demonstrates how to deploy and interact with a `HelloWorld` smart contract and a `CounterInternal` contract:

```typescript
describe('CounterInternal', () => {
    let codeHelloWorld: Cell;
    let blockchain: Blockchain;
    let helloWorld: SandboxContract<HelloWorld>;
    let counterInternal: SandboxContract<CounterInternal>;
    let keyPair: KeyPair;

    beforeAll(async () => {
        codeHelloWorld = await compile('HelloWorld');
    });

    beforeEach(async () => {
        blockchain = await Blockchain.create();

        // Generate a key pair for HelloWorld
        const seed = await getSecureRandomBytes(32);
        keyPair = keyPairFromSeed(seed);

        // Deploy HelloWorld contract
        helloWorld = blockchain.openContract(
            HelloWorld.createFromConfig(
                {
                    id: 0,
                    seqno: 0,
                    publicKey: keyPair.publicKey
                },
                codeHelloWorld
            )
        );

        const deployerHello = await blockchain.treasury('deployerHello');
        const deployResultHello = await helloWorld.sendDeploy(deployerHello.getSender(), toNano('1.00'));

        expect(deployResultHello.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
            from: deployerHello.address,
            to: helloWorld.address,
            deploy: true,
            success: true
        });

        // Deploy CounterInternal with HelloWorld as the owner
        counterInternal = blockchain.openContract(
            await CounterInternal.fromInit(0n, helloWorld.address)
        );

        const deployerCounter = await blockchain.treasury('deployerCounter');
        const deployResultCounter = await counterInternal.send(deployerCounter.getSender(), { value: toNano('1.00') }, {
            $$type: 'Deploy',
            queryId: 0n
        });

        expect(deployResultCounter.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
            from: deployerCounter.address,
            to: counterInternal.address,
            deploy: true,
            success: true
        });
    });

    it('should fail if not owner call increment', async () => {
        // Verify owner is correctly set to HelloWorld
        const ownerAddress = await counterInternal.getOwner();
        expect(ownerAddress.equals(helloWorld.address)).toBe(true);

        // Get initial counter value
        const counterBefore = await counterInternal.getCounter();

        // Try to increase counter from a non-owner account (should fail)
        const nonOwner = await blockchain.treasury('nonOwner');
        const increaseBy = 5n;

        const nonOwnerResult = await counterInternal.send(nonOwner.getSender(), {
            value: toNano('0.05')
        }, {
            $$type: 'Add',
            amount: increaseBy,
            queryId: 0n
        });

        // This should fail since only the owner should be able to increment
        expect(nonOwnerResult.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
            from: nonOwner.address,
            to: counterInternal.address,
            success: false,
            exitCode: 132 // The error code thrown in the contract, Access Denied
        });

        // Counter should remain unchanged
        const counterAfterNonOwner = await counterInternal.getCounter();
        expect(counterAfterNonOwner).toBe(counterBefore);
    });

    it('should increment from HelloWorld contract', async () => {
        const increaseBy = 5n;
        const counterBefore = await counterInternal.getCounter();

        // Create internal message to increase counter that will be sent from HelloWorld
        const internalMessageBody = beginCell().store(storeAdd({
            $$type: 'Add',
            amount: increaseBy,
            queryId: 0n
        })).endCell();

        const messageToSend = beginCell().store(storeMessageRelaxed(internal({
            to: counterInternal.address,
            value: toNano(0.01),
            body: internalMessageBody,
            bounce: true
        }))).endCell();

        // Send external message to HelloWorld that contains internal message to CounterInternal
        const result = await helloWorld.sendExternal({
            mode: SendMode.PAY_GAS_SEPARATELY,
            message: messageToSend,
            secret_key: keyPair.secretKey
        });

        // Verify the external message was processed successfully
        expect(result.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
            from: undefined, // External messages have no 'from' address
            to: helloWorld.address,
            success: true
        });

        // Verify the internal message was sent from HelloWorld to CounterInternal
        expect(result.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
            from: helloWorld.address,
            to: counterInternal.address,
            success: true
        });

        // Verify the counter was increased
        const counterAfter = await counterInternal.getCounter();
        expect(counterAfter).toBe(counterBefore + increaseBy);
    });
});
```

Congratulations! You have successfully created a **multi-contract** system and learned how to handle **internal messages**. This example illustrates the typical flow of any message chain: sending an `external message`, triggering the `internal messages` flow based on your system model, and so on. Now that our contracts have been fully tested, we are ready to deploy them and interact with them on-chain.
