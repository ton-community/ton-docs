# Processing Messages

> **Summary:** In previous steps we modified our smart contract interaction with `storage`, `get methods` and learned basic smart contract development flow.

Now we are ready to move on to the main functionality of smart contracts - **sending and receiving messages**. In TON messages not only used for sending currency, but also as data-exchange mechanism between smart contracts making them crucial for smart contract development.

## Internal messages

Before we proceed to implementation let's briefly describe main ways and patterns that we can use to process internal messages.

### Actors and roles

Since TON implements [actor](/v3/concepts/dive-into-ton/ton-blockchain/blockchain-of-blockchains/#single-actor/) model it's natural to think about smart contracts relations in terms of `roles`, determining who can access smart contract functionality or not. The most common examples of roles are:

 - `anyone`: any contract that don't have distinct role.
 - `owner`: contract that has exclusive access to some crucial parts of functionality.

Let's examine `recv_internal` function signature to understand how we could use that:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="FunC" label="FunC">
```func
() recv_internal(int my_balance, int msg_value, cell in_msg_full, slice in_msg_body) impure
```
 - `my_balance` - balance of smart contract at the beggining of the transaction.
 - `msg_value` - funds recieved with message.
 - `in_msg_full` - `cell` containing "header" fields of message.
 - `in_msg_body` - [slice](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/func/docs/types#atomic-types) containg payload of the message.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Tolk" label="Tolk">
```tolk
fun onInternalMessage(myBalance: int, msgValue: int, msgFull: cell, msgBody: slice)
```
 - `myBalance` - balance of smart contract at the beggining of the transaction.
 - `msgValue` - funds recieved with message.
 - `msgFull` - `cell` containing "header" fields of message.
 - `msgBody` - [slice](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/func/docs/types#atomic-types) containg payload pf the message.
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info
You can find comprehensive description of sending messages in this [section](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/message-management/sending-messages#message-layout/).
:::

What we specifically are interested in is the source address of message that we could extract from `msg_full` cell, by obtaining that address and comparing to stored one, that we previously saved, for example, during deployment, we can open crucial part of our smart contract functionality. Common approach looks like this:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="FunC" label="FunC">
```func
;; This is NOT a part of the project, just an example.
() recv_internal(int my_balance, int msg_value, cell in_msg_full, slice in_msg_body) impure {
    ;; Parse the sender address from in_msg_full
    slice cs = in_msg_full.begin_parse();
    int flags = cs~load_uint(4);
    slice sender_address = cs~load_msg_addr();

    ;; check if message was send by owner
    if (equal_slices_bits(sender_address, owner_address)) {
      ;;owner operations
      return
    } else if (equal_slices_bits(sender_address, other_role_address)){
      ;;other role operations
      return
    } else {
      ;;anyone else operations
      return
    }

    ;;no known operation were obtained for presented role
    ;;0xffff is not standard exit code, but is standard practice among TON developers
    throw(0xffff);
}
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Tolk" label="Tolk">
```tolk
// This is NOT a part of the project, just an example.
fun onInternalMessage(myBalance: int, msgValue: int, msgFull: cell, msgBody: slice) {
    // Parse the sender address from in_msg_full
    var cs: slice = msgFull.beginParse();
    val flags = cs.loadMessageFlags();
    var sender_address = cs~load_msg_address();

    if (isSliceBitsEqual(sender_address, owner_address)) {
      // owner operations
      return
    } else if (isSliceBitsEqual(sender_address, other_role_address)){
      // other role operations
      return
    } else {
      // anyone else operations
      return
    }

    throw 0xffff; // if the message contains an op that is not known to this contract, we throw
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Operations

Common pattern in TON contracts is to include a **32-bit operation code** in message bodies which tells your contract what action to perform:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="FunC" label="FunC">
```func
;; This is NOT a part of the project, just an example!
const int op::increment = 1;
const int op::decrement = 2;

() recv_internal(int my_balance, int msg_value, cell in_msg_full, slice in_msg_body) impure {
    ;; Step 1: Check if the message is empty
    if (in_msg_body.slice_empty?()) {
        return; ;; Nothing to do with empty messages
    }

    ;; Step 2: Extract the operation code
    int op = in_msg_body~load_uint(32);

    ;; Step 3-7: Handle the requested operation
    if (op == op::increment) {
        increment();   ;;call to specific operation handler
        return;
    } else if (op == op::decrement) {
        decrement();
        ;; Just accept the money
        return;
    }

    ;; Unknown operation
    throw(0xffff);
}
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Tolk" label="Tolk">
```tolk
//This is NOT a part of the project, just an example!
const op::increment : int = 1;
const op::decrement : int = 2;

fun onInternalMessage(myBalance: int, msgValue: int, msgFull: cell, msgBody: slice) {
    // Step 1: Check if the message is empty
    if (slice.isEndOfSlice()) {
        return; // Nothing to do with empty messages
    }

    // Step 2: Extract the operation code
    var op = in_msg_body~load_uint(32);

    // Step 3-7: Handle the requested operation
    if (op == op::increment) {
        increment();   //call to specific operation handler
        return;
    } else if (op == op::decrement) {
        decrement();
        // Just accept the money
        return;
    }

    // Unknown operation
    throw(0xffff);
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>


By combining both of these patterns you can achieve a comprehensive description of your smart contract's systems ensuring secure interaction between them and unleash full potential of TON actors model.

## Implementation in Tact

Tact is a high-level programming language for the TON Blockchain, focused on efficiency and simplicity. It is designed to be easy to learn and use while being well-suited for smart contract development. Tact is a statically typed language with a simple syntax and a powerful type system.

:::info
For more details, refer to the [Tact documentation](https://docs.tact-lang.org/#start/) and [Tact By Example](https://tact-by-example.org/00-hello-world/).
:::

Let's create and modify our smart contract folowing standard steps decsribed in previous [Blueprint SDK overview](/v3/guidelines/quick-start/developing-smart-contracts/blueprint-sdk-overview/) section.

### Step 1: Creating and modifying Tact contract

First, let's create Tact contract in the same directory as previous one.

```bash
npx blueprint create CounterInternal --type tact-counter
```

Resulted project structure should look like this:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="FunC" label="FunC">
```ls title="Project structure"
Example/
├─ contracts/                  # Smart contract source code

│  ├─ incrementCounterInternal.ts # Script to increment counter
│  └─ incrementHelloWorld.ts      # Script to increment counter
├─ tests/                      # Test suite for contracts
│  ├─ CounterInternal.spec.ts     # Tests for CounterInternal contract

└─ wrappers/                   # Wrappers for contract interaction
   ├─ CounterInternal.compile.ts  # Compilation configuration
   ├─ CounterInternal.ts          # Wrapper for CounterInternal contract
   ├─ HelloWorld.compile.ts       # Compilation configuration
   └─ HelloWorld.ts               # Wrapper for HelloWorld contract
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Tolk" label="Tolk">
```ls title="Project structure"
Example/
├─ contracts/                  # Smart contract source code
│  ├─ counter_internal.tact    # CounterInternal contract in Tact language
│  ├─ hello_world.tolk         # HelloWorld contract in FunC language
├─ scripts/                    # Deployment and interaction scripts
│  ├─ deployCounterInternal.ts    # Script to deploy contract
│  ├─ deployHelloWorld.ts         # Script to deploy contract
│  ├─ incrementCounterInternal.ts # Script to increment counter
│  └─ incrementHelloWorld.ts      # Script to increment counter
├─ tests/                      # Test suite for contracts
│  ├─ CounterInternal.spec.ts     # Tests for CounterInternal contract
│  └─ HelloWorld.spec.ts          # Tests for HelloWorld contract
└─ wrappers/                   # Wrappers for contract interaction
   ├─ CounterInternal.compile.ts  # Compilation configuration
   ├─ CounterInternal.ts          # Wrapper for CounterInternal contract
   ├─ HelloWorld.compile.ts       # Compilation configuration
   └─ HelloWorld.ts               # Wrapper for HelloWorld contract
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

At the top of the generated contract file: `counter_internal.tact`, you may see a [message](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/structs-and-messages/) definition:

```tact title="/contracts/counter_internal.tact"
message Add {
    queryId: Int as uint64;
    amount: Int as uint32;
}
```

A message is a basic structure for communication between contracts. Tact automatically serializes and deserializes messages into cells. To ensure that opcodes will be the same during message structure changes, it may be added like below:

```tact title="/contracts/counter_internal.tact"
message(0x7e8764ef) Add {
    queryId: Int as uint64;
    amount: Int as uint32;
}
```

Tact will serialize it as follows:

```func
begin_cell()
    .store_uint(0x7e8764ef, 32) ;; message opcode
    .store_uint(query_id, 64)
    .store_uint(amount, 32)
    .end_cell()
```

Using this structure, a message can be sent to the contract from FunC.

#### Defining the contract

The [contract](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/contracts/) definition in Tact follows an object-oriented programming style:

```tact
contract CounterInternal {
    ...
}
```

#### Contract storage

A contract may store its state variables as follows. They may be accessed with [`Self reference`](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/contracts/#self)

```tact
id: Int as uint32;
counter: Int as uint32;
```

To ensure that only the contract owner can interact with specific functions, add an `owner` field:

```tact title="/contracts/counter_internal.tact"
id: Int as uint32;
counter: Int as uint32;
owner: Address;
```

These fields are serialized similarly to structures and stored in the contract's data register.

#### Initializing the contract

If you compile the contract at this stage, you will encounter the error: `Field "owner" is not set`. This is because the contract needs to initialize its fields upon deployment. Define an [`init()`](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/contracts/#init-function/) function to do this:

```tact title="/contracts/counter_internal.tact"
init(id: Int, owner: Address) {
    self.id = id;
    self.counter = 0;
    self.owner = owner;
}
```

#### Handling messages

To accept messages from other contracts, use a [receiver](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/functions/#receiver-functions) function. Receiver functions automatically match the message's opcode and invoke the corresponding function:

```tact title="/contracts/counter_internal.tact"
receive(msg: Add) {
    self.counter += msg.amount;
    self.notify("Cashback".asComment());
}
```

For accepting messages with empty body you can add `recieve` function with no arguments:

```tact title="/contracts/counter_internal.tact"
receive() { 
    cashback(sender()) 
}
```

#### Restricting access


Tact also provides handy ways to share same logic through [traits](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/types/#traits). To ensure that only the contract owner can send messages use the `Ownable` trait, which provides built-in ownership checks:

```tact title="/contracts/counter_internal.tact"
// Import library to use trait
import "@stdlib/ownable";

// Ownable trait introduced here
contract CounterInternal with Ownable {

    ...

    receive(msg: Add) {
        self.requireOwner();
        self.counter += msg.amount;
        self.notify("Cashback".asComment());
    }
}
```

:::info
[Identity validation](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/security-best-practices/#identity-validation) plays a key role in secure contract interactions. You can read more about identity validation and its importance in the linked documentation.
:::

#### Getter functions

Tact supports [getter functions](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/functions/#getter-functions) for retrieving contract state off-chain:

:::note
Get function cannot be called from another contract.
:::

```tact title="/contracts/counter_internal.tact"
get fun counter(): Int {
    return self.counter;
}
```

Note, that the `owner` getter is automatically defined via the `Ownable` trait.

#### Complete contract

```tact title="/contracts/counter_internal.tact"
import "@stdlib/ownable";

// message with opcode
message(0x7e8764ef) Add {
    queryId: Int as uint64;
    amount: Int as uint32;
}

// Contract defenition. `Ownable` is a trait to share functionality.
contract CounterInternal with Ownable {

    // storage variables
    id: Int as uint32;
    counter: Int as uint32;
    owner: Address;

    // init function.
    init(id: Int, owner: Address) {
        self.id = id;
        self.counter = 0;
        self.owner = owner;
    }

    // default(null) recieve for deploy
    receive() { 
        cashback(sender()) 
    }

    // function to recive messages from other contracts
    receive(msg: Add) {
        // function from `Ownable` trait to assert, that only owner may call this
        self.requireOwner();
        self.counter += msg.amount;

        // Notify the caller that the receiver was executed and forward remaining value back
        self.notify("Cashback".asComment());
    }

    // getter function to be called offchain
    get fun counter(): Int {
        return self.counter;
    }

    get fun id(): Int {
        return self.id;
    }
}
```

Verify that smart contract code is correct by running build script:

```bash
npx blueprint build 
```

Expected output should look like this:

```bash
✅ Compiled successfully! Cell BOC result:

}

✅ Wrote compilation artifact to build/CounterInternal.compiled.json
```

### Step 2: Update wrapper

[Wrappers](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/compile/#wrap-ts) facilitate contract interaction from TypeScript. Unlike in FunC or Tolk, they are generated automatically during the build process:

```typescript title="/wrappers/CounterInternal.ts"
export * from '../build/CounterInternal/tact_CounterInternal';
```

### Step 3: Updating tests

Now let's ensure that our smart contract code fails when we try to send `add` message from non-owner:
 - Create `CounterInternal` with some owner.
 - Create another smart contract that will have different address - `nonOwner`.
 - Try to send an internal message to `CounterInternal` and enusre that it fails with expected `exitCode` and counter field remains the same.

Implementation of test should look like this:

```typescript title="/tests/CounterInternal.spec.ts"
import { Blockchain, SandboxContract, TreasuryContract} from '@ton/sandbox';
import { Cell, toNano } from '@ton/core';
import { CounterInternal } from '../wrappers/CounterInternal';
import '@ton/test-utils';
import { compile } from '@ton/blueprint';

describe('CounterInternal', () => {
    let codeHelloWorld: Cell;
    let blockchain: Blockchain;
    let counterInternal: SandboxContract<CounterInternal>;
    let deployerCounter: SandboxContract<TreasuryContract>;

    beforeAll(async () => {
        codeHelloWorld = await compile('HelloWorld');
    });

    beforeEach(async () => {
        blockchain = await Blockchain.create();

        deployerCounter = await blockchain.treasury('deployerCounter');

        // Deploy CounterInternal with deployer as the owner
        counterInternal = blockchain.openContract(
            await CounterInternal.fromInit(0n, deployerCounter.address)
        );

        const deployResultCounter = await counterInternal.send(
            deployerCounter.getSender(), 
            { value: toNano('1.00') }, 
            null
        );

        expect(deployResultCounter.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
            from: deployerCounter.address,
            to: counterInternal.address,
            deploy: true,
            success: true
        });
    });

    it('should fail if not owner call increment', async () => {
        // Get initial counter value
        const counterBefore = await counterInternal.getCounter();

        // Try to increase counter from a non-owner account (should fail)
        const nonOwner = await blockchain.treasury('nonOwner');
        const increaseBy = 5n;

        const nonOwnerResult = await counterInternal.send(nonOwner.getSender(), {
            value: toNano('0.05')
        }, {
            $$type: 'Add',
            amount: increaseBy,
            queryId: 0n
        });

        // This should fail since only the owner should be able to increment
        expect(nonOwnerResult.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
            from: nonOwner.address,
            to: counterInternal.address,
            success: false,
            exitCode: 132 // The error code thrown in the contract, Access Denied
        });

        // Counter should remain unchanged
        const counterAfterNonOwner = await counterInternal.getCounter();
        expect(counterAfterNonOwner).toBe(counterBefore);
    });
});

```

Don't forget to verify that all examples is correct by running test script:

```bash
npx blueprint test
```

Expected output should look like this:

```bash
 PASS  tests/CounterInternal.spec.ts
  CounterInternal
    ✓ should fail if not owner call increment (506 ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       1 passed, 1 total
Snapshots:   0 total

Ran all test suites matching /CounterInternal/i.
```

## External Messages

`External messages` are your only way of toggling smart contract logic from outside the blockchain. Usually, there is no need for implementation of them in smart contracts because in most cases you don't want external entry points to be accessible to anyone except you. If this is all functionality that you want from external section - standard way is to delegate this responsibility to separate actor - [wallet](v3/documentation/smart-contracts/contracts-specs/wallet-contracts#basic-wallets/), which is practically the main reason they were designed for.

Developing external endpoint includes several standard [approuches](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/message-management/external-messages/) and [security measures](/v3/guidelines/smart-contracts/security/overview/) that might be overwhelming at this point. Therefore in this guide we will realize incrementing previously added to `hello_world` contract `ctxCounterExt` number and add send message to out `Tact` contract.

:::danger
This implementation is **unsafe** and may lead to loosing your contract funds. Don't deploy it to `Mainnet`, especially with high smart contract balance.
:::

## Implementation

Let's modify our smart contract to recieve external messages folowing standard steps decsribed in previous [Blueprint SDK overview](/v3/guidelines/quick-start/developing-smart-contracts/blueprint-sdk-overview/) section.

### Step1 : Edit smart contract code

Add `recv_external` function to `HelloWorld` smart contract:

<Tabs groupId="language">
<TabItem value="FunC" label="FunC">
```func title="/contracts/hello_world.fc"
() recv_external(slice in_msg) impure {
    accept_message();

    var (ctx_id, ctx_counter, ctx_counter_ext) = load_data();

    var query_id = in_msg~load_uint(64);
    var addr = in_msg~load_msg_addr();
    var coins = in_msg~load_coins();
    var increase_by = in_msg~load_uint(32);

    var msg = begin_cell()
        .store_uint(0x18, 6)
        .store_slice(addr)
        .store_coins(coins)
        .store_uint(0, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1)
        .store_uint(op::increase, 32)
        .store_uint(query_id, 64)
        .store_uint(increase_by, 32);
    send_raw_message(msg.end_cell(), 0);

    ctx_counter_ext += increase_by;
    save_data(ctx_id, ctx_counter, ctx_counter_ext);

    return ();
}
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Tolk" label="Tolk">
```tolk title="/contracts/HelloWorld.tolk"
fun acceptExternalMessage(): void
    asm "ACCEPT";

fun onExternalMessage(inMsg: slice) {
    acceptExternalMessage();
    var (ctxId, ctxCounter, ctxCounterExt) = loadData();

    var queryId = inMsg.loadUint(64);
    var addr = inMsg.loadAddress();
    var coins = inMsg.loadCoins();
    var increaseBy = inMsg.loadUint(32);

    var msg = beginCell()
        .storeUint(0x18, 6)
        .storeSlice(addr)
        .storeCoins(coins)
        .storeUint(0, 1 + 4 + 4 + 64 + 32 + 1 + 1)
        .storeUint(OP_INCREASE, 32)
        .storeUint(queryId, 64)
        .storeUint(increaseBy, 32);
    sendRawMessage(msg.endCell(), 0);

    ctxCounterExt += increaseBy;
    saveData(ctxId, ctxCounter, ctxCounterExt);

    return ();

This function upon recieving an external message will increment our `ctxCounter` and also send an internal message to specified address with `increase` operation that we will use to increment counter on our `CounterInternal` smart contract.


Verify that smart contract code is correct by running:

```bash
npx blueprint build
```

Expected should look like this:

```bash

}

✅ Wrote compilation artifact to build/HelloWorld.compiled.json
```

### Step 2: Update Wrapper 

And add wrapper method to call it through our wrapper class for sending external message:

```typescript title="/wrappers/HelloWorld.ts"
async sendExternalIncrease(
    provider: ContractProvider,
    opts: {
        increaseBy: number;
        value: bigint;
        addr: Address;
        queryID?: number;
    }
) {
    const message = beginCell()
        .storeUint(opts.queryID ?? 0, 64)
        .storeAddress(opts.addr)
        .storeCoins(opts.value)
        .storeUint(opts.increaseBy, 32)
    .endCell()

    return await provider.external(message);
}
```

### Step 3: Update test

Update test to ensure that `HelloWorld` contract recieved external message, sended internal message to `CounterInternal` contract and both updated their counters:

```typescript title="/tests/HelloWorld.spec.ts"
import { Blockchain, SandboxContract, TreasuryContract } from '@ton/sandbox';
import { Cell, toNano} from '@ton/core';
import { HelloWorld } from '../wrappers/HelloWorld';
import { CounterInternal } from '../wrappers/CounterInternal';
import '@ton/test-utils';
import { compile } from '@ton/blueprint';

describe('HelloWorld', () => {
    let code: Cell;

    beforeAll(async () => {
        code = await compile('HelloWorld');
    });

    let blockchain: Blockchain;
    let deployer: SandboxContract<TreasuryContract>;
    let helloWorld: SandboxContract<HelloWorld>;
    let counterInternal: SandboxContract<CounterInternal>;

    beforeEach(async () => {
        blockchain = await Blockchain.create();

        helloWorld = blockchain.openContract(
            HelloWorld.createFromConfig(
                {
                    id: 0,
                    ctxCounter: 0,
                    ctxCounterExt: 0n,
                },
                code
            )
        );

        deployer = await blockchain.treasury('deployer');

        const deployResult = await helloWorld.sendDeploy(deployer.getSender(), toNano('1.00'));

        expect(deployResult.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
            from: deployer.address,
            to: helloWorld.address,
            deploy: true,
            success: true,
        });

        counterInternal = blockchain.openContract(
            await CounterInternal.fromInit(0n, helloWorld.address)
        );

        const deployResultCounter = await counterInternal.send(
            deployer.getSender(), 
            { value: toNano('1.00') }, 
            null
        );

        expect(deployResultCounter.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
            from: deployer.address,
            to: counterInternal.address,
            deploy: true,
            success: true
        });
    });

    it('should send an external message and update counter', async () => {
        const counterInternalValueBefore = await counterInternal.getCounter();
        const [__, counterExtBefore] = await helloWorld.getCounters()
        const increase = 5;

        const result = await helloWorld.sendExternalIncrease({
            increaseBy: increase,
            value: toNano(0.05),
            addr: counterInternal.address,
            queryID: 0
        });

        expect(result.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
            from: undefined, // External messages have no 'from' address
            to: helloWorld.address,
            success: true,
        });

        expect(result.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
            from: helloWorld.address,
            to: counterInternal.address,
            success: true,
        });

        const counterInternalValueAfter = await counterInternal.getCounter();

        expect(counterInternalValueAfter).toBeGreaterThan(counterInternalValueBefore);
        const [_, counterExt] = await helloWorld.getCounters()
        expect(counterExtBefore + BigInt(increase)).toBe(counterExt);
    });

    // ... previous tests
});
```

This test describes common trascantion flow of any `multi-contract` system: 
 1. Send external message to toggle smart contracts logic from outside the blockchain.
 2. Provoke one or more sending of internal messages to other contracts.
 3. Upon recieving an internal message change contract state and repeat **step 2** if required.

Since resulting sequence of transactions might be overwhelming for understanding, it's a good practice to make a `sequence diagram` describing your system, here is an example of our case:

<div style={{marginBottom: '30px'}} align="center">
  <img src="/img/tutorials/quick-start/multi-contract.png" alt="Multi-contract scheme"/>
</div>

Verify that all examples is correct by running test script:

```bash
npx blueprint test
```

Expected output should look like this:

```bash
 PASS  tests/HelloWorld.spec.ts
  HelloWorld
    ✓ should correctly initialize and return the initial data (446 ms)
    ✓ should send an external message and update counter (209 ms)
    ✓ should increase counter (298 ms)
