# Storage and get methods

> **Summary:** In the previous steps, we learned how to use the `Blueprint SDK` and its project structure.

Smart contracts often need to store data, like counters or ownership information, and provide a way to read or update it through messages. In this section, you’ll learn how to define and initialize contract storage, receive and handle incoming messages, and create getter functions to read contract states outside the blockchain.

Let's create and modify our smart contract following the standard steps described in the previous [Blueprint overview](/v3/guidelines/quick-start/developing-smart-contracts/tact-folder/tact-blueprint-sdk-overview/) section.


## Step 1: edit smart contract code


At the top of the generated contract file: `hello_world.tact`, you may see a **message** definition:

```tact title="/contracts/hello_world.tact"
message Add {
    queryId: Int as uint64;
    amount: Int as uint32;
}
```

A **message** is a structure that sends data into a contract from another contract or outside the blockchain.
Tact simplifies working with messages by automatically serializing and deserializing them into [TVM cells](https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/msg-tlb). You don’t need to write low-level serialization code or think about bit layout manually — Tact handles that for you.

Every message is assigned a unique 32-bit identifier called an **opcode** (short for operation code). This identifier is stored at the beginning of the serialized message and helps the contract understand what type of message it is *receiving*.

By default, Tact automatically assigns this identifier. However, you can also define it manually, for example, when evolving the structure of your messages over time:

```tact title="/contracts/hello_world.tact"
message(0x7e8764ef) Add {
    queryId: Int as uint64;
    amount: Int as uint32;
}
```


<details>
  <summary><b>Tact automatically serializes messages into TVM cells.</b></summary>

  When compiled, Tact will automatically serialize this message into a TVM cell. Internally, it would be represented something like this:

  ```func
  begin_cell()
  .store_uint(0x7e8764ef, 32) ;; message opcode
  .store_uint(query_id, 64)
  .store_uint(amount, 32)
  .end_cell()
  ```

  Usually, you don’t need to think about this — Tact takes care of it behind the scenes. However, it can be helpful to understand when debugging or interacting with low-level language like FunC.

#### Defining the contract

The [contract](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/contracts/) definition in Tact follows an object-oriented programming style:

```tact
contract HelloWorld {
    ...
}
```

#### Contract storage

A contract may store its state variables as follows. They may be accessed with [`Self reference`](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/contracts/#self)

```tact
id: Int as uint32;
counter: Int as uint32;
```
These fields are serialized similarly to structures and stored in the contract's data register.

Use `self.id` and `self.counter` to access them within contract functions.

#### Initializing the contract

Define an [`init()`](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/contracts/#init-function/) function to set initial values:

```tact title="/contracts/hello_world.tact"
init(id: Int) {
    self.id = id;
    self.counter = 0;
}
```

#### Handling messages

To accept messages from other contracts, use a [receiver](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/functions/#receiver-functions) function. Receiver functions automatically match the message's opcode and invoke the corresponding function:

```tact title="/contracts/hello_world.tact"
receive(msg: Add) {
    self.counter += msg.amount;
    self.notify("Cashback".asComment());
}
```

For accepting messages with empty body you can add `receive` function with no arguments:

```tact title="/contracts/hello_world.tact"
receive() {
    cashback(sender())
}
```

#### Getter functions

Tact supports [getter functions](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/functions/#getter-functions) for retrieving contract state off-chain:

:::note
Get function cannot be called from another contract.
:::

```tact title="/contracts/hello_world.tact"
get fun counter(): Int {
    return self.counter;
}
```

#### Complete contract

```tact title="/contracts/hello_world.tact"
// message with opcode
message(0x7e8764ef) Add {
    queryId: Int as uint64;
    amount: Int as uint32;
}

// Contract defenition
contract HelloWorld {

    // storage variables
    id: Int as uint32;
    counter: Int as uint32;

    // init function.
    init(id: Int) {
        self.id = id;
        self.counter = 0;
    }

    // default(null) receive for deploy
    receive() {
        cashback(sender())
    }

    // function to receive messages from other contracts
    receive(msg: Add) {
        self.counter += msg.amount;

        // Notify the caller that the receiver was executed and forward remaining value back
        self.notify("Cashback".asComment());
    }

    // getter function to be called offchain
    get fun counter(): Int {
        return self.counter;
    }

    get fun id(): Int {
        return self.id;
    }
}
```

Verify that smart contract code is correct by running build script:

```bash
npx blueprint build
```

Expected output should look like this:

```bash

}

✅ Wrote compilation artifact to build/HelloWorld.compiled.json
```

## Step 2: update wrapper

After building your contract, Tact automatically generates a special wrapper file. This [wrapper]((https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/compile/#wrap-ts)) simplifies interaction with your contract from TypeScript, such as calling its methods or sending messages.

In the wrapper file, you'll find this line of code:

```typescript title="/wrappers/HelloWorld.ts"
export * from '../build/HelloWorld/tact_HelloWorld';
```

This code exports everything inside the `tact_HelloWorld.ts` file in the build folder, making it available for use in other files.

## Step 3: updating tests


<details>
  <summary><b>Updating tests</b></summary>

  Now let's ensure that our smart contract correctly updates the counter:
  - Deploy the `HelloWorld` contract with an initial ID.
  - Check that the initial counter value is `0`.
  - Send an `Add` message to increment the counter.
  - Verify that the counter value increases by the expected amount.


  Implementation of test should look like this:

  ```typescript title="/tests/HelloWorld.spec.ts"
  // @version TypeScript 5.8.3
  import { Blockchain, SandboxContract, TreasuryContract } from '@ton/sandbox';
  import { toNano } from '@ton/core';
  import { HelloWorld } from '../wrappers/HelloWorld';
  import '@ton/test-utils';

  describe('HelloWorld Basic Tests', () => {
  let blockchain: Blockchain;
  let helloWorld: SandboxContract<HelloWorld>;
  let sender: SandboxContract<TreasuryContract>;

  beforeEach(async () => {
  blockchain = await Blockchain.create();
  sender = await blockchain.treasury('user');

  helloWorld = blockchain.openContract(
  // init with id = 0
  await HelloWorld.fromInit(0n)
  );

  const deployResult = await helloWorld.send(
  sender.getSender(),
{ value: toNano('1') },
  null
  );

  expect(deployResult.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
  from: sender.address,
  to: helloWorld.address,
  deploy: true,
  success: true
});
});

  it('should initialize with id = 0 and counter = 0', async () => {
  const id = await helloWorld.getId();
  const counter = await helloWorld.getCounter();
  expect(id).toBe(0n);
  expect(counter).toBe(0n);
});

  it('should increase counter by given amount', async () => {
  const result = await helloWorld.send(
  sender.getSender(),
{ value: toNano('0.1') },
{
  $$type: 'Add',
  queryId: 0n,
  amount: 10n
}
  );

  expect(result.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
  from: sender.address,
  to: helloWorld.address,
  success: true
});

  const counter = await helloWorld.getCounter();
  expect(counter).toBe(10n);
});
});

  ```

  Don't forget to verify the example is correct by running test script:

  ```bash
  npx blueprint test
  ```

  Expected output should look like this:

  ```bash

  PASS  tests/HelloWorld.spec.ts
  HelloWorld Basic Tests
  ✓ should initialize with id = 0 and counter = 0 (305 ms)
  ✓ should increase counter by given amount (120 ms)

  Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
  Tests:       2 passed, 2 total
  Snapshots:   0 total
  Time:        1.399 s
  Ran all test suites.

## Next step

You've written your first smart contract using Tact, tested it, and explored how storage and get methods work.

Now, it's time to **deploy the contract** to TON Blockchain.
