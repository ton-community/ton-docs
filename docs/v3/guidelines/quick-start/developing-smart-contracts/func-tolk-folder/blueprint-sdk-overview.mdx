# Blueprint overview

> **Summary:** In the previous steps, we installed and configured all the tools required for TON smart contract development and created our first project template.

Before we proceed to actual smart contract development, let's briefly describe the project structure and explain how to use the **`Blueprint`**.

## Project structure

:::warning
If you didn't choose the proposed names in the previous steps, source code file names and some of the in-code entities may differ.

### `/contracts`

This folder contains your smart contract source code written in one of the available programming languages used for TON Blockchain smart contract development.

### `/scripts`

The `scripts` directory contains `TypeScript` files that help you deploy and interact with your smart contracts on-chain using previously implemented wrappers.

### `/tests`

This directory contains test files for your smart contracts. Testing contracts directly on the TON network is not the best option because deployment requires some amount of time and may lead to losing funds. This testing playground allows you to execute multiple smart contracts and even send messages between them in your **"local network"**. Tests are crucial for ensuring your smart contracts behave as expected before deployment to the network.

### `/wrappers`

To interact with your smart contract off-chain, you need to serialize and deserialize messages sent to it. `Wrapper` classes are developed to mirror your smart contract implementation, making its functionality simple to use.


## Development flow

Almost any smart contract project development consists of five simple steps:

1. Edit the smart contract code in the `/contracts` folder and build it by running the build script:

```bash
npx blueprint build
```

2. Update the smart contract wrapper in the `/wrappers` folder to correspond to changes in the contract.

3. Update tests in the `/tests` folder to ensure the correctness of the new functionality and run the test script:

```bash
npx blueprint test
```

4. Repeat steps 1-3 until you achieve the desired result.

5. Update the deployment script in the `/scripts` folder and run it using this command:

```bash
npx blueprint run
```

:::tip
All examples in this guide follow the sequence of these **1-3 steps** with corresponding code samples. **Step 5**, the deployment process, is covered in the last section of the guide: [Deploying to network](/v3/guidelines/quick-start/developing-smart-contracts/deploying-to-network/).
:::

Also, you can always generate the same structure for another smart contract if, for example, you want to create multiple contracts interacting with each other by using the following command:

```bash
npx blueprint create PascalCase # Don't forget to name the contract in PascalCase
```

## Next step

Now you’re all set — it's time to start writing smart contracts. We’ll begin with the basics: **storage** and **get methods**.
