# Set up development environment

> **Summary:** In the previous steps, we learned the concept of a smart contract and basic ways of interacting with TON Blockchain through **wallets** and **explorers**.

This guide covers the basic steps of setting up your smart contract development environment using **Blueprint** and creating a basic project template.

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming skills.
- Familiarity with the command-line interface.

## Set up development environment

For this guide, we will rely on the [Blueprint](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/getting-started/javascript) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)/TypeScript stack for writing wrappers, tests, and deployment scripts for your smart contract, as it provides the easiest, ready-to-use environment for smart contract development.

### Step 1: install Node.js

Install Node.js for your OS (Windows, macOS, or Linux) using the official installer or a package manager, then verify with the following commands.

Check that npm and node are installed by executing the following commands:

```bash
npm -v
node -v
```

### Step 2: choose a smart contract development language

During the guide, we provide examples in FunC, Tolk, and Tact. You can choose any of them and even combine smart contracts in different languages. To proceed through the guide, there is no need for a deep understanding of the chosen languageâ€”basic programming skills will be enough.

You can find a brief overview of the languages here: [Programming languages](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/overview#programming-languages).

### Step 3: set up Blueprint

Change the directory to the parent folder of your future project and run the following command:

```bash
npm create ton@latest
```

This will run an interactive script to create the project template. You can enter anything you want, but if you want to follow the same names and options as in this guide, choose the following:

1. **Project name**: `Example`  
2. **First contract name**: `HelloWorld`  
3. **Project template**: a **simple counter contract** in Tolk, FunC, or Tact


Finally, change your current directory to the generated project template folder and install all required dependencies:

```bash
cd ./Example
npm install
```

### Step 4: set up IDE

TON has plugins that provide syntax support for several IDEs and code editors. You can find them here: [plugin list](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/getting-started/ide-plugins).

Also, consider installing plugins that support **JavaScript/TypeScript** tools for your preferred IDE or code editor, specifically Jest, for debugging smart contract tests.
