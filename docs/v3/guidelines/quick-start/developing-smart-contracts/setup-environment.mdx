# Setup development environment

> **Summary:** In previous steps we learned concept of smart contract and basic ways of interacting with TON blockchain through **wallet apps** and **explorers**.

This guide covers basic steps of setting up your smart contract development environment using **`Blueprint SDK`** and creating basic project template.

## Prerequisites

 - Basic programming skills.
 - Familiarity with Command-line interface.

## Setup development environment

For this guide we will rely on [Blueprint SDK](https://github.com/ton-org/blueprint/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)/TypeScript stack for writing wrappers, tests and deployments scripts for your smart contract, because its provides easiest, ready to use environment for smart contracts developing. 

:::info
Using native instruments and language-dependent SDK's for smart contract development covered in more advanced sections here:
 - [Compile and build smart contracts on TON](/v3/documentation/archive/compile#ton-compiler/).
 - [Creating State Init for Deployment](/v3/guidelines/smart-contracts/howto/wallet#creating-the-state-init-for-deployment/).

### Step 1: Install Node.js

First, visit [installation page](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and execute download commands in `PowerShell` or `Bash` corresponding to your operating system Windows/Linux. 

Check that `npm` and `node` installed by executing following command:

```bash
npm -v
node -v
```

### Step 2: Choose smart contract development language

During guide we provide example on: `Func`, `Tolk` and `Tact`. You can choose from any of them and even combine smart contracts on different languages. To proceed through guide there is now need of deep understanding of choosed one, basic programming skills will be enought.

You can find breaf overview of languages here: [Programming languages](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/overview#programming-languages/)

### Step 3: Setup Blueprint SDK

Change directory to parent folder of your future project and run following command:

```bash
npm create ton@latest
```

This will run interactive script for creating project template, you can enter anything you want, but if you want to have same paths as this guide choose following:
1. Project name: `Example`.
2. First created contract name: `HelloWorld`.
3. Choose the project template: A **simple counter contract** on `FunC` or `Tolk`.

And finally, change your current directory to generated project template folder, and install all required dependencies:

```bash
cd ./Example
npm install
```

### Step 4(optional): IDE and editors support

Ton community developed plugins providing syntax support for several IDE's and code editors. You can find them here: [Plugin List](https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/getting-started/ide-plugins/).

Also consider installing plugins providing support for **JavaScript/TypeScript** tools for your preferred IDE or code editor and, specifically, `Jest` for debugging smart contract tests.
