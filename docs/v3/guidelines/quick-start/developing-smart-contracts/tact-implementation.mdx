# Tact implementation

Tact is a high-level programming language for the TON Blockchain, focused on efficiency and simplicity. It is designed to be easy to learn and use while being well-suited for smart contract development. Tact is a statically typed language with a simple syntax and a powerful type system.

:::info
For more details, refer to the [Tact documentation](https://docs.tact-lang.org/#start/) and [Tact By Example](https://tact-by-example.org/00-hello-world/).
:::

Let's create and modify our smart contract following standard steps described in the previous [Blueprint SDK overview](/v3/guidelines/quick-start/developing-smart-contracts/blueprint-sdk-overview/) section.

## Step 1: Creating and modifying Tact contract

First, let's set up the environment for the Tact smart contract. To do that, you need a parent folder of your future project and run the following command:

```bash
npm create ton@latest
```

This will run interactive script for creating project template, you can enter anything you want, but if you want to have same paths as this guide choose the following:
1. Project name: `Example`.
2. First created contract name: `CounterInternal`.
3. Choose the project template: A **simple counter contract** on `Tact`.

At the top of the generated contract file: `counter_internal.tact`, you may see a message definition:

```tact title="/contracts/counter_internal.tact"
message Add {
    queryId: Int as uint64;
    amount: Int as uint32;
}
```

A message is a basic structure for communication between contracts. Tact automatically serializes and deserializes messages into cells. To ensure that opcodes will be the same during message structure changes, it may be added like below:

```tact title="/contracts/counter_internal.tact"
message(0x7e8764ef) Add {
    queryId: Int as uint64;
    amount: Int as uint32;
}
```

Tact will serialize it as follows:

```func
begin_cell()
    .store_uint(0x7e8764ef, 32) ;; message opcode
    .store_uint(query_id, 64)
    .store_uint(amount, 32)
    .end_cell()
```

Using this structure, a message can be sent to the contract from FunC.

#### Defining the contract

The [contract](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/contracts/) definition in Tact follows an object-oriented programming style:

```tact
contract CounterInternal {
    ...
}
```

#### Contract storage

A contract may store its state variables as follows. They may be accessed with [`Self reference`](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/contracts/#self)

```tact
id: Int as uint32;
counter: Int as uint32;
```

To ensure that only the contract owner can interact with specific functions, add an `owner` field:

```tact title="/contracts/counter_internal.tact"
id: Int as uint32;
counter: Int as uint32;
owner: Address;
```

These fields are serialized similarly to structures and stored in the contract's data register.

#### Initializing the contract

If you compile the contract at this stage, you will encounter the error: `Field "owner" is not set`. This is because the contract needs to initialize its fields upon deployment. Define an [`init()`](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/contracts/#init-function/) function to do this:

```tact title="/contracts/counter_internal.tact"
init(id: Int, owner: Address) {
    self.id = id;
    self.counter = 0;
    self.owner = owner;
}
```

#### Handling messages

To accept messages from other contracts, use a [receiver](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/functions/#receiver-functions) function. Receiver functions automatically match the message's opcode and invoke the corresponding function:

```tact title="/contracts/counter_internal.tact"
receive(msg: Add) {
    self.counter += msg.amount;
    self.notify("Cashback".asComment());
}
```

For accepting messages with empty body you can add `recieve` function with no arguments:

```tact title="/contracts/counter_internal.tact"
receive() {
    cashback(sender())
}
```

#### Restricting access


Tact also provides handy ways to share same logic through [traits](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/types/#traits). To ensure that only the contract owner can send messages, use the `Ownable` trait, which provides built-in ownership checks:

```tact title="/contracts/counter_internal.tact"
// Import library to use trait
import "@stdlib/ownable";

// Ownable trait introduced here
contract CounterInternal with Ownable {

    ...

    receive(msg: Add) {
        self.requireOwner();
        self.counter += msg.amount;
        self.notify("Cashback".asComment());
    }
}
```

:::info
[Identity validation](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/security-best-practices/#identity-validation) plays a key role in secure contract interactions. You can read more about identity validation and its importance in the linked documentation.
:::

#### Getter functions

Tact supports [getter functions](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/functions/#getter-functions) for retrieving contract state off-chain:

:::note
Get function cannot be called from another contract.
:::

```tact title="/contracts/counter_internal.tact"
get fun counter(): Int {
    return self.counter;
}
```

Note, that the `owner` getter is automatically defined via the `Ownable` trait.

#### Complete contract

```tact title="/contracts/counter_internal.tact"
import "@stdlib/ownable";

// message with opcode
message(0x7e8764ef) Add {
    queryId: Int as uint64;
    amount: Int as uint32;
}

// Contract defenition. `Ownable` is a trait to share functionality.
contract CounterInternal with Ownable {

    // storage variables
    id: Int as uint32;
    counter: Int as uint32;
    owner: Address;

    // init function.
    init(id: Int, owner: Address) {
        self.id = id;
        self.counter = 0;
        self.owner = owner;
    }

    // default(null) recieve for deploy
    receive() {
        cashback(sender())
    }

    // function to recive messages from other contracts
    receive(msg: Add) {
        // function from `Ownable` trait to assert, that only owner may call this
        self.requireOwner();
        self.counter += msg.amount;

        // Notify the caller that the receiver was executed and forward remaining value back
        self.notify("Cashback".asComment());
    }

    // getter function to be called offchain
    get fun counter(): Int {
        return self.counter;
    }

    get fun id(): Int {
        return self.id;
    }
}
```

Verify that smart contract code is correct by running build script:

```bash
npx blueprint build
```

Expected output should look like this:

```bash

}

✅ Wrote compilation artifact to build/CounterInternal.compiled.json
```

## Step 2: update wrapper

[Wrappers](https://docs.tact-lang.org/book/compile/#wrap-ts) facilitate contract interaction from TypeScript. Unlike in FunC or Tolk, they are generated automatically during the build process:

```typescript title="/wrappers/CounterInternal.ts"
export * from '../build/CounterInternal/tact_CounterInternal';
```

## Step 3: updating tests

Now let's ensure that our smart contract code fails when we try to send `add` message from non-owner:
 - Create `CounterInternal` with some owner.
 - Create another smart contract that will have different address - `nonOwner`.
 - Try to send an internal message to `CounterInternal` and enusre that it fails with expected `exitCode` and counter field remains the same.

Implementation of test should look like this:

```typescript title="/tests/CounterInternal.spec.ts"
import { Blockchain, SandboxContract, TreasuryContract } from '@ton/sandbox';
import { toNano } from '@ton/core';
import { CounterInternal } from '../wrappers/CounterInternal';
import '@ton/test-utils';

describe('CounterInternal Basic Tests', () => {
    let blockchain: Blockchain;
    let counterInternal: SandboxContract<CounterInternal>;
    let owner: SandboxContract<TreasuryContract>;

    beforeEach(async () => {
        // Create a new blockchain instance
        blockchain = await Blockchain.create();

        // Create an owner wallet
        owner = await blockchain.treasury('owner');

        // Deploy the contract
        counterInternal = blockchain.openContract(
            await CounterInternal.fromInit(0n, owner.address)
        );

        // Send deploy transaction
        const deployResult = await counterInternal.send(
            owner.getSender(),
            { value: toNano('1.00') },
            null
        );

        // Verify deployment was successful
        expect(deployResult.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
            from: owner.address,
            to: counterInternal.address,
            deploy: true,
            success: true
        });
    });

    it('should initialize with correct values', async () => {
        // Check initial counter value
        const initialCounter = await counterInternal.getCounter();
        expect(initialCounter).toBe(0n);

        // Check initial ID
        const id = await counterInternal.getId();
        expect(id).toBe(0n);
    });

    it('should allow owner to increment counter', async () => {
        // Get initial counter value
        const initialCounter = await counterInternal.getCounter();

        // Increment counter by 5
        const incrementAmount = 5n;
        const result = await counterInternal.send(
            owner.getSender(),
            { value: toNano('0.05') },
            {
                $$type: 'Add',
                amount: incrementAmount,
                queryId: 0n
            }
        );

        // Verify transaction was successful
        expect(result.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
            from: owner.address,
            to: counterInternal.address,
            success: true
        });

        // Check counter was incremented correctly
        const newCounter = await counterInternal.getCounter();
        expect(newCounter).toBe(initialCounter + incrementAmount);
    });

    it('should prevent non-owner from incrementing counter', async () => {
        // Create a non-owner wallet
        const nonOwner = await blockchain.treasury('nonOwner');

        // Get initial counter value
        const initialCounter = await counterInternal.getCounter();

        // Try to increment counter as non-owner
        const result = await counterInternal.send(
            nonOwner.getSender(),
            { value: toNano('0.05') },
            {
                $$type: 'Add',
                amount: 5n,
                queryId: 0n
            }
        );

        // Verify transaction failed
        expect(result.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
            from: nonOwner.address,
            to: counterInternal.address,
            success: false
        });

        // Verify counter was not changed
        const newCounter = await counterInternal.getCounter();
        expect(newCounter).toBe(initialCounter);
    });

    it('should handle multiple increments correctly', async () => {
        // Perform multiple increments
        const increments = [3n, 7n, 2n];
        let expectedCounter = 0n;

        for (const amount of increments) {
            await counterInternal.send(
                owner.getSender(),
                { value: toNano('0.05') },
                {
                    $$type: 'Add',
                    amount: amount,
                    queryId: 0n
                }
            );
            expectedCounter += amount;
        }

        // Verify final counter value
        const finalCounter = await counterInternal.getCounter();
        expect(finalCounter).toBe(expectedCounter);
    });
});

```

Don't forget to verify the example is correct by running test script:

```bash
npx blueprint test
```

Expected output should look like this:

```bash

 PASS  tests/CounterInternal.spec.ts
  CounterInternal Basic Tests
    ✓ should initialize with correct values (211 ms)
    ✓ should allow owner to increment counter (100 ms)
