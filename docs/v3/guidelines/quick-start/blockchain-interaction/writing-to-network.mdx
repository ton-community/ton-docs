# Writing to network

In the previous section, you learned how to **read data** from TON Blockchain. Now, let's explore how to **write data** to it. Writing to the TON network involves sending messages. These messages trigger actions in smart contracts, such as transferring TON, Jettons, NFTs,  updating contract state, or deploying new contracts.

## Setting up the project

First, let's initialize the project and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
npm init -y
npm install typescript ts-node @ton/ton @ton/core
npx tsc --init
```

## Send TON

## Send Jetton

## Send NFT
