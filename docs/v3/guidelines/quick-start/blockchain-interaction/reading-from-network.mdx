# Reading from network

This page will walk you through how to read data from TON Blockchain. We'll cover fetching account information, calling get methods, and retrieving account transactions. By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of how to read from TON blockchain using HTTP-based APIs.

## Introduction to TON Actors

In TON, [**Actors**](/v3/concepts/dive-into-ton/ton-blockchain/blockchain-of-blockchains#single-actor/) are objects that have *storage* and *behavior*. These are essentially smart contracts with properties, like `address`, `state`, `code`, `data`, `balance`.

All these properties can be retrieved using [TON HTTP-based APIs](/v3/guidelines/dapps/apis-sdks/ton-http-apis/). In this guide, we'll use [TON Center](https://toncenter.com/), a fast and reliable HTTP API for TON.

## Setting up the project

## Setting Up the Project

First, let's initialize the project and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
npm init -y
npm install typescript ts-node @ton/ton @ton/core @ton/crypto
npx tsc --init
```

To run scripts, use the following command:

```bash
npx ts-node script.ts
```

## Reading account information

Account information includes the `balance`, `state`, `code`, and `data`.
- `balance`: The amount of TON the account holds.
- `state`: Can be one of:
  - **Nonexist**: The address has no data.
  - **Uninit**: The address has a balance but no smart contract code.
  - **Active**: The address is live with code and balance.
  - **Frozen**: The address is locked due to insufficient balance for storage costs.
- `code`: The contract's code in raw format.
- `data`: Serialized contract data stored in a [*Cell*](/v3/concepts/dive-into-ton/ton-blockchain/cells-as-data-storage/).

Here's how you can retrieve a contract's state:

```typescript
import { Address, TonClient } from "@ton/ton";

async function main() {
  const tonClient = new TonClient({
    endpoint: 'https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC',
  });

  const state = await tonClient.getContractState(Address.parse('0QD-SuoCHsCL2pIZfE8IAKsjc0aDpDUQAoo-ALHl2mje04A-')); // Replace with any address
  console.log(state);
}

main();
```

## Calling get methods

Get methods are special functions in smart contracts that allow you to query specific data. Their execution doesn't cost any fees and happens outside the blockchain.

These functions are widespread in most smart contracts. For example, the default Wallet contract has several get methods, such as `seqno()`, `get_subwallet_id()` and `get_public_key()`. Sometimes get methods has parameters like `get_wallet_address(slice owner_address)`.

Result of calling get method from TON HTTP API comes in *stack* format and may be deserialized one by one using `readNumber()` or similar function.

```typescript
import { Address, TonClient, TupleBuilder } from "@ton/ton";

async function main() {
  const tonClient = new TonClient({
    endpoint: 'https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC',
  });

  // Building optional get method parameters list
  const builder = new TupleBuilder();
  builder.writeAddress(Address.parse('0QD-SuoCHsCL2pIZfE8IAKsjc0aDpDUQAoo-ALHl2mje04A-'));

  const result = await tonClient.runMethod(
    Address.parse('kQD0GKBM8ZbryVk2aESmzfU6b9b_8era_IkvBSELujFZPsyy'), // address to call get method on
    'get_wallet_address', // method name
    builder.build(), // optional params list
  );

  // deserializing get method result
  const address = result.stack.readAddress();
  console.log(address);
}

main();
```

### Using wrappers for simplicity

Wrappers are classes that simplify interactions with smart contracts. Here's an equivalent example using a wrapper:

```typescript
import { Address, JettonMaster, TonClient } from "@ton/ton";

async function main() {
  const tonClient = new TonClient({
    endpoint: 'https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC',
  });

  // initializing wrappers
  const jettonMaster = tonClient.open(
    JettonMaster.create(Address.parse('kQD0GKBM8ZbryVk2aESmzfU6b9b_8era_IkvBSELujFZPsyy')),
  );

  // calling get method through wrapper
  const address = jettonMaster.getWalletAddress(Address.parse('0QD-SuoCHsCL2pIZfE8IAKsjc0aDpDUQAoo-ALHl2mje04A-'));
  console.log(address);
}

main();
```

## Fetching account transactions

Interaction within account on blockchain happens due to [messages and transactions](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/message-management/messages-and-transactions/).

### What is a message?

A message is a packet of data exchanged between actors (users, applications, or smart contracts). It typically contains information instructing the receiver on what action to perform, such as updating storage or sending a new message.

<div class="text--center">
  <ThemedImage
    alt=""
    sources={{
      light: '/img/docs/message-delivery/message_delivery_1.png?raw=true',
      dark: '/img/docs/message-delivery/message_delivery_1_dark.png?raw=true',
    }}
  />
</div>

### What is a transaction?

A transaction in TON consists of the following:
- the incoming message that initially triggers the contract (special ways to trigger exist)
- contract actions caused by the incoming message, such as an update to the contract's storage (optional)
- outgoing messages generated and sent to other actors (optional)

<ThemedImage

  sources={{
    light: '/img/docs/message-delivery/message_delivery_2.png?raw=true',
    dark: '/img/docs/message-delivery/message_delivery_2_dark.png?raw=true',
  }}
/>

Transaction obtained from API have the following structure:

```json5

```

### Key transaction fields

- `address`: The account address where the transaction occurred.
- `utime`: The UNIX timestamp of the transaction.
- `transaction_id.lt`: [Logical time](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/message-management/messages-and-transactions/#what-is-a-logical-time/), used to determine the order of events.
- `fee`: [Total fees](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/transaction-fees/fees/) in nanoTON paid during the transaction.
- `in_msg`: The incoming [message](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/message-management/messages-and-transactions#what-is-a-message/) that triggered the transaction.
- `out_msgs`: Outgoing messages sent during the transaction.

### Key message fields

- `hash`: Message hash. May be used to determine the transaction using [TonApi](https://tonapi.io/api-v2#operations-Blockchain-getBlockchainTransaction).
- `source`: The address of the sender (the account that initiated the message).
- `destination`: The address of the receiver (the account that will process the message).
- `value`: The amount of TON (in nanoTON) attached to the message.
- `fwd_fee`: [Forward fees](https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/transaction-fees/forward-fees/) is the cost of delivering the message to the destination contract.
- `created_lt`: [Logical time](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/message-management/messages-and-transactions/#what-is-a-logical-time/) when the message was created.
- `msg_data`: Contains message body and state init.


### How to get account transactions?

Hereâ€™s how to fetch the last 10 transactions for an account:

```typescript
import { Address, TonClient } from "@ton/ton";

async function main() {
  const tonClient = new TonClient({
    endpoint: 'https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC',
  });

  const transactions = await tonClient.getTransactions(
    Address.parse('0QD-SuoCHsCL2pIZfE8IAKsjc0aDpDUQAoo-ALHl2mje04A-'), // Address to fetch transactions
    {
      limit: 10,
      archival: true,
    },
  );

  console.log(transactions[0]);
}

main();
```
