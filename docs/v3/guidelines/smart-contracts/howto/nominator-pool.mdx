# How to use the nominator pool

:::tip
Before reading this tutorial, you should familiarize yourself with [nominator pool specification](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/contracts-specs/nominator-pool).
:::

## Running the validator in nominator pool mode \{#validator-pool-mode}

1. Set up the hardware for the validator — you will need 16 cores CPU, 128 GB RAM, 1 TB NVMe SSD (or ≥64k IOPS), 1 Gbit/s network connectivity, Public IP.

   To maintain network stability, distribute validator nodes across different geographical locations worldwide rather than concentrating them in a single data center. See [recommended providers](/v3/guidelines/nodes/running-nodes/full-node#recommended-providers).

   :::caution
   Ensure your hardware meets or exceeds the specifications above. Running the validator on insufficient hardware negatively impacts the network and could result in penalties.

2. Install and synchronize **MyTonCtrl** as described in the guide [here](/v3/guidelines/nodes/running-nodes/full-node#install-mytonctrl).

   For additional help, refer to this video tutorial.

3. Transfer 1 TON to the validator wallet address listed by the `wl` command.

4. Use the `aw` command to activate your validator wallet.

5. Activate pool mode:

   Run in the MyTonCtrl console.

   ```text
   enable_mode nominator-pool
   set stake null
   ```

6. Create two pools (for even and odd validation rounds):

   Run in the MyTonCtrl console.

   ```text
   new_pool p1 0 1 1000 300000
   new_pool p2 0 1 1001 300000
   ```

   Where:

   - `p1` is the pool name;
   - `0%` is the validator's reward share (e.g., use 40 for 40%);
   - `1` is the maximum number of nominators in the pool (should be \<= 40);
   - `1000` TON is the minimum validator stake (should be >= 1K TON);
   - `300000` TON is the minimum nominator stake (should be >= 10K TON);

   :::note
   Pool configurations do not have to be identical. You can add 1 to the minimum stake of one pool to make them different.
   :::

   :::tip
   Use https://tonmon.xyz/ to determine the current minimum validator stake.
   :::

7. Type `pools_list` to display pool addresses:

   Run in the MyTonCtrl console.

   ```text
   pools_list
   Name  Status  Balance  Address
   p1    empty   0        0f98YhXA9wnr0d5XRXT-I2yH54nyQzn0tuAYC4FunT780qIT
   p2    empty   0        0f9qtmnzs2-PumMisKDmv6KNjNfOMDQG70mQdp-BcAhnV5jL
   ```

   :::info
   Addresses may appear in raw form (starting with `0f…`) or user-friendly form (starting with `kf…`). Both represent the same address in different formats.
   :::

8. Send 1 TON to each pool and activate the pools:

   Run in the MyTonCtrl console.

   ```text
   mg validator_wallet_001 0f98YhXA9wnr0d5XRXT-I2yH54nyQzn0tuAYC4FunT780qIT 1
   mg validator_wallet_001 0f9qtmnzs2-PumMisKDmv6KNjNfOMDQG70mQdp-BcAhnV5jL 1
   activate_pool p1
   activate_pool p2
   ```

9. Type `pools_list` to display pools:

   Run in the MyTonCtrl console.

   ```text
   pools_list
   Name  Status  Balance      Address
   p1    active  0.731199733  kf98YhXA9wnr0d5XRXT-I2yH54nyQzn0tuAYC4FunT780v_W
   p2    active  0.731199806  kf9qtmnzs2-PumMisKDmv6KNjNfOMDQG70mQdp-BcAhnV8UO
   ```

10. Open each pool via the link `https://tonscan.org/nominator/{address_of_pool}` and verify each pool’s configuration.

11. Proceed with the validator deposit to each pool:

    Run in the MyTonCtrl console.

    ```text
    deposit_to_pool validator_wallet_001 <address_of_pool_1> 1005
    deposit_to_pool validator_wallet_001 <address_of_pool_2> 1005
    ```

In these commands, `1005` TON is the deposit amount. Ensure you attach sufficient fees as required; see the [nominator pool specification](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/contracts-specs/nominator-pool) for details.

12. Make a nominator deposit to each pool.

    Visit the pool link (from **Step 10**) and click **ADD STAKE**.
    You can also make a deposit using **MyTonCtrl** with the following commands:

    Run in the MyTonCtrl console.

    ```text
    mg nominator_wallet_001 <address_of_pool_1> 300001 -C d
    mg nominator_wallet_001 <address_of_pool_2> 300001 -C d
    ```

:::info
The nominator wallet must be initialized in the basechain (workchain 0).
:::

:::caution
Remember that the validator and nominator wallets must be stored separately! Store the validator wallet on the server with the validator node to ensure the processing of all system transactions. Meanwhile, store the nominator wallet in your cold cryptocurrency wallet.
:::

:::note
To withdraw a nominator deposit, send a transaction with the comment `w` to the pool address (attach 1 TON to process the transaction). You can also perform this action using **mytonctrl**.
:::

13. Invite nominators to deposit into your pools. Participation in validation will commence automatically.

:::note
Ensure you have at least 200 TON/month in your validator wallet for operation fees.

In the TON blockchain, the validator cycle is approximately 18 hours, and there are roughly 40.5 validation rounds per month (assuming a 30-day month).

Here's the breakdown of costs based on participation:

- **Participating in only odd or even cycles (half of the rounds):**
  - Rounds per month: ~20.25
  - Cost per round: ~5 Toncoins
  - `total cost = 20.25 * 5 -> ~101.25 Toncoins`

- **Participating in both odd and even cycles (all rounds):**
  - Rounds per month: ~40.5
  - Cost per round : ~ 5 Toncoins
  - `total cost = 40.5 * 5 -> ~202.50 Toncoins`
:::


## Pool configuration

If you intend to self-nominate, use `new_pool p1 0 1 1000 300000` (maximum of 1 nominator, 0% validator share).

If you're creating a pool for numerous nominators, you might use something like this: `new_pool p1 40 40 10000 10000` (maximum of 40 nominators, 40% validator share, minimum participant stakes of 10K TON).

## Transitioning a regular validator to nominator pool mode

1. Input `set stake 0` to discontinue election participation.

2. Await the return of both your stakes from the elector.

3. Proceed with the steps under [Running the validator in nominator pool mode](#validator-pool-mode) from the **4th step** onwards.
