# How to use a single nominator pool

:::tip
Before proceeding with this tutorial, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the [single nominator pool specification](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/contracts-specs/single-nominator-pool).
:::

### Set up single nominator mode

:::caution
Before starting, ensure you have topped up and [activated](/v3/guidelines/nodes/running-nodes/validator-node#activate-the-wallets) the validator's wallet.
:::

1. Enable single nominator mode:

```bash
MyTonCtrl> enable_mode single-nominator
```

2. Verify if single nominator mode is enabled:

```bash
MyTonCtrl> status_modes
Name              Status   Description
single-nominator  enabled  Orbs's single nominator pools.
```

3. Create a pool:

```bash
MyTonCtrl> new_single_pool <pool-name> <owner_address>
```

If you have already created a pool, you can import it:

```bash
MyTonCtrl> import_pool <pool-name> <pool-addr>
```

4. Display pool addresses using `pools_list`:

```bash
MyTonCtrl> pools_list
Name       Status  Balance  Version   Address
test-pool  empty   0.0      spool_r2  kf_JcC5pn3etTAdwOnc16_tyMmKE8-ftNUnf0OnUjAIdDJpX
```

5. Activate the pool:

```bash
MyTonCtrl> activate_single_pool <pool-name>
```

After successfully activating the pool:

```bash
MyTonCtrl> pools_list
Name       Status  Balance  Version   Address
test-pool  active  0.99389  spool_r2  kf_JcC5pn3etTAdwOnc16_tyMmKE8-ftNUnf0OnUjAIdDJpX
```

You can manage this pool via MyTonCtrl like a standard nominator pool.

:::info
If the pool's balance is sufficient to participate in both rounds (`balance > min_stake_amount * 2`), MyTonCtrl will automatically participate in both rounds using `stake = balance / 2`, unless you manually set the stake using the `set stake` command. This behavior differs from using a nominator pool but resembles staking with a validator wallet.
:::

## Start without MyTonCtrl

#### Prepare a launched validator

If you have MyTonCtrl installed and a validator running:

1. Stop validation and withdraw all funds.

#### Prepare from scratch

If you have no prior validator setup, follow these steps:

1. [Run a validator](/v3/guidelines/nodes/running-nodes/full-node) and ensure it is synced.
2. Stop validation and withdraw all funds.

### Prepare single nominator

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v.16 or later and npm ([detailed instructions](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#debian-and-ubuntu-based-distributions)).
2. Install `ts-node` and the `arg` module:

```bash
$ sudo apt install ts-node
$ sudo npm i arg -g
```

3. Create symlinks for compilers:

```bash
$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/ton/crypto/fift /usr/local/bin/fift
$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/ton/crypto/func /usr/local/bin/func
```

4. Run a test to verify the setup:

```bash
$ npm run test
```

5. Replace MyTonCtrl nominator-pool scripts: [Install pool scripts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orbs-network/single-nominator/main/mytonctrl-scripts/install-pool-scripts.sh).

### Create a single nominator pool

1. Obtain a TON Center API key from [@tonapibot](https://t.me/tonapibot) on Telegram.
2. Set environment variables:

```bash
export OWNER_ADDRESS=<owner_address>
export VALIDATOR_ADDRESS=<validator_wallet_address>
export TON_ENDPOINT=https://toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC
export TON_API_KEY=<toncenter_api_key>
```

3. Create a deployer address:

```bash
$ npm run init-deploy-wallet
Insufficient Deployer [EQAo5U...yGgbvR] funds 0
```

4. Top up the deployer address with 2.1 TON.
5. Deploy the pool contract to get the pool address (`Ef-kC0..._WLqgs`):

```bash
$ npm run deploy
```

6. Convert the address to `.addr`:

```bash
$ fift -s ./scripts/fift/str-to-addr.fif Ef-kC0..._WLqgs
```

(Saving address to file single-nominator.addr)

7. Back up the deployer private key (`./build/deploy.config.json`) and `single-nominator.addr` files.
8. Copy `single-nominator.addr` to `mytoncore/pools/single-nominator-1.addr`.
9. Send a stake from the owner's address to the single nominator's address.

### Withdrawals from the single nominator

#### Using wallets to withdraw

**Fift:**

1. Create a `withdraw.boc` request with the desired amount:

```bash
$ fift -s ./scripts/fift/withdraw.fif <withdraw_amount>
```

2. Create and sign the request from the owner's wallet:

```bash
$ fift -s wallet-v3.fif <my-wallet> <single_nominator_address> <sub_wallet_id> <seqno> <amount=1> -B withdraw.boc
```

3. Broadcast the query:

```bash
$ lite-client -C global.config.json -c 'sendfile wallet-query.boc'
```

**Tonkeeper:**

1. Create a `withdraw.boc` request with the desired amount:

```bash
$ fift -s ./scripts/fift/withdraw.fif <withdraw_amount>
```

2. Send the request to the single nominator address:

```bash
$ tons wallet transfer <my-wallet> <single_nominator_address> <amount=1> --body withdraw.boc
```

3. Link TypeScript:

```bash
npm link typescript
```

4. Generate a deeplink:

```bash
npx ts-node scripts/ts/withdraw-deeplink.ts <single-nominator-addr> <withdraw-amount>
```

5. Open the deeplink on the owner's phone.

## Deposit to pool

You can deposit using **MyTonCtrl** with the following commands:

```sh
MyTonCtrl> mg <from-wallet-name> <pool-account-addr> <amount>
```

or

```sh
MyTonCtrl> deposit_to_pool <pool-addr> <amount>
```

Alternatively, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the pool’s page: `https://tonscan.org/nominator/{pool_address}`.
2. Ensure the pool information is displayed correctly. If the pool has an incorrect smart contract, no information will appear.
3. Click the `ADD STAKE` button or scan the QR code using Tonkeeper or another TON wallet.
4. Enter the TON amount and send the transaction. The TON coins will then be added to staking.

If the wallet does not open automatically, manually send the transaction by copying the pool address and using any TON wallet. Note that 1 TON will be deducted as a commission for processing the deposit.

## Withdraw funds

You can withdraw funds using the following command:

```sh
MyTonCtrl> withdraw_from_pool <pool-addr> <amount>
```

Alternatively, create and send the transaction manually:

<Tabs groupId="code-examples">
<TabItem value="toncore" label="JS (@ton)">

```js
import {
  Address,
  beginCell,
  internal,
  storeMessageRelaxed,
  toNano,
} from "@ton/core";

async function main() {
  const single_nominator_address = Address.parse("single nominator address");
  const WITHDRAW_OP = 0x1000;
  const amount = 50000;

  const messageBody = beginCell()
    .storeUint(WITHDRAW_OP, 32) // op code for withdrawal
    .storeUint(0, 64) // query_id
    .storeCoins(amount) // amount to withdraw
    .endCell();

  const internalMessage = internal({
    to: single_nominator_address,
    value: toNano("1"),
    bounce: true,
    body: messageBody,
  });
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="tonconnect" label="Golang">

```go
func WithdrawSingleNominatorMessage(single_nominator_address string, query_id, amount uint64) (*tonconnect.Message, error) {

    const WITHDRAW_OP = 0x1000;

    payload, _ := cell.BeginCell().
        MustStoreUInt(WITHDRAW_OP, 32). // op code for withdrawal
        MustStoreUInt(query_id, 64).    // query_id
        MustStoreCoins(amount).        // amount to withdraw
        EndCell().MarshalJSON();

    msg, err := tonconnect.NewMessage(
        single_nominator_address,
        tlb.MustFromTON("1").Nano().String(), // nanocoins to transfer/compute message
        tonconnect.WithPayload(payload));

    if err != nil {
        return nil, err;
 }

    return msg, nil;
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Election process

### Set up a single nominator pool

Configure the single nominator pool contract using the [following instructions](/v3/guidelines/smart-contracts/howto/single-nominator-pool#set-up-single-nominator).

### Join the elections

[Deposit](/v3/guidelines/smart-contracts/howto/single-nominator-pool#deposit-pool) the minimum stake amount into the single nominator pool.

**MyTonCtrl** will automatically join the elections. You can set the stake amount that MyTonCtrl sends to the [elector contract](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/contracts-specs/governance#elector) approximately every 18 hours on Mainnet and 2 hours on Testnet.

```sh
MyTonCtrl> set stake 90000
```

Find the **minimum stake** amount using the `status` command.

![](/img/docs/single-nominator/tetsnet-conf.png)

You can set `stake` to `null`, which will calculate based on the `stakePercent` value (check with `status_settings`).

Verify if the election has started:

```bash
MyTonCtrl> status
```

For Testnet:

```bash
MyTonCtrl> status fast
```

Example:

![](/img/docs/single-nominator/election-status.png)

If the election has started and the single nominator pool is activated, the validator will **automatically** send an **ElectorNewStake** message to the elector contract at the beginning of the next round.

Check the validator wallet:

```sh
MyTonCtrl> wl
Name                  Status  Balance           Ver  Wch  Address
validator_wallet_001  active  995.828585374     v1   -1   kf_dctjwS4tqWdeG4GcCLJ53rkgxZOGGrdDzHJ_mxPkm_Xct
```

Check the transaction history:

```sh
MyTonCtrl> vas kf_dctjwS4tqWdeG4GcCLJ53rkgxZOGGrdDzHJ_mxPkm_Xct
Address                                           Status  Balance        Version
kf_dctjwS4tqWdeG4GcCLJ53rkgxZOGGrdDzHJ_mxPkm_Xct  active  995.828585374  v1r3

```

This **ElectorNewStake** transaction appears in the single nominator contract history on Tonviewer:

![](/img/docs/single-nominator/new-stake.png)

In this example, **MyTonCtrl** automatically staked `90000` Toncoins on the elector contract.

### Check validator status

At the beginning of the next round, check the validator status with the `status` command (`status fast` on Testnet).

![](/img/docs/single-nominator/status-validator.png)

Confirm if your node has become a full validator by checking:

1. **Validator efficiency** – The local validator's efficiency should be green and not `n/a`.
2. **Validator index** – The validator index should be greater than -1.

### Check profit

At the end of the round, **MyTonCtrl** sends an **ElectorRecoverStakeRequest** message to the elector contract. It returns `stake + profit` to your single nominator pool.

![](/img/docs/single-nominator/validator-profit.png)

You can also check the pool's transaction history with the `vas` command:

![](/img/docs/single-nominator/validator-profit-vas.png)

### Stop participating

If you no longer wish to participate in validation:

1. Disable validator mode:

```bash
MyTonCtrl> disable_mode validator
```

2. [Withdraw](/v3/guidelines/smart-contracts/howto/single-nominator-pool#withdraw-funds) all funds from the single nominator contract to the owner wallet.

## Transitioning a regular validator to nominator pool mode

1. Disable the `validator` mode to stop participating in elections.
2. Wait for both stakes to return from the elector.
3. Follow the [steps](/v3/guidelines/smart-contracts/howto/single-nominator-pool#set-up-single-nominator) to set up a single nominator pool.

## Single nominator pool client

- Use the open-source client [Single nominator client](https://github.com/orbs-network/single-nominator-client) to deploy and interact with the contract.
- For support, contact the team on [Telegram](https://t.me/single_nominator).

## Run a single nominator pool with a vesting contract

Initially, the owner of the vesting contract manages it with their wallet contract. This scheme involves managing interactions between multiple contracts.

| Contracts               | Interface for managing                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `validator_wallet`      | MyTonCtrl                                   |
| `vesting`               | [vesting.ton.org](https://vesting.ton.org/) |
| `owner_wallet`          | Apps like Tonkeeper or MyTonWallet          |
| `single_nominator_pool` | MyTonCtrl                                   |

- `owner_wallet` – The TON wallet that owns the `vesting`.

:::caution
Ensure you have backed up the vesting `owner_wallet` recovery phrase. If you lose access to the `owner_wallet`, you will also lose access to managing the `vesting` funds, and recovery will be impossible.
:::

1. Run a full node and wait for it to sync.
2. Enable validator mode and retrieve the `wallet_v1` address created during installation using `MyTonCtrl wl`.
3. Send 200 TON (for monthly expenses) to the `validator_wallet`.
4. Create a `single_nominator_pool`:

```bash
MyTonCtrl> new_single_pool <pool-name> <vesting>
```

Example:

```bash
MyTonCtrl> new_single_pool my_s_pool EQD...lme-D
```

5. Activate the `single_nominator_pool`:

```bash
MyTonCtrl> activate_single_pool <pool-name>
```

Example:

```bash
MyTonCtrl> activate_single_pool my_s_pool
```

6. After the `single_nominator_pool` address appears on-chain, request whitelisting from the person who provided the vesting contract.
7. Once whitelisted, you can send locked tokens from the `vesting` contract to the `single_nominator_pool` using [vesting.ton.org](https://vesting.ton.org/):
   - a. Connect the `owner_wallet` on [vesting.ton.org](https://vesting.ton.org/).
   - b. Test by sending 10 TON from `vesting` to the `single_nominator_pool`.
   - c. Return the remaining funds (~8 TON) to `vesting` with a message [amount 0, comment `w`] via the [vesting.ton.org](https://vesting.ton.org/) interface.
   - d. Confirm the remaining funds are received in `vesting`.
8. Transfer the required TON amount from `vesting` to `single_nominator_pool` for both cycles.
9. Wait for the validators’ voting.
