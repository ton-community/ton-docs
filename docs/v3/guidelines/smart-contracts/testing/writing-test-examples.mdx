# Writing tests examples

This page demonstrates how to write tests for FunC contracts created with the [Blueprint SDK](https://github.com/ton-org/blueprint) ([Sandbox](https://github.com/ton-org/sandbox)).  
The test suites are built for the demo contract [Fireworks](https://github.com/ton-community/fireworks-func). Fireworks is a smart contract that initially runs via the `set_first` message.

When you create a new FunC project using `npm create ton@latest`, the SDK automatically generates a test file `tests/contract.spec.ts` in the project directory for testing the contract:

```typescript
import ...

describe('Fireworks', () => {
    ...

    expect(deployResult.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
        ...
    });
});

it('should deploy', async () => {
    // The check is done inside beforeEach
    // blockchain and fireworks are ready to use
});
```

Run tests using the following command:

```bash
npx blueprint test
```

You can specify additional options and vmLogs using `blockchain.verbosity`:

```typescript
blockchain.verbosity = {
  ...blockchain.verbosity,
  blockchainLogs: true,
  vmLogs: "vm_logs_full",
  debugLogs: true,
  print: false,
};
```

## Direct unit tests

The Fireworks contract demonstrates different ways of sending messages in the TON Blockchain.

    dark: "/img/docs/writing-test-examples/test-examples-schemes-dark.svg?raw=true",
  }}
/>
<br></br>
When you deploy the contract with the `set_first` message and sufficient TON amount,
it automatically executes with primary and usable combinations of send modes.{" "}

The Fireworks contract redeploys itself, creating three entities, each with its own ID (stored in the contract) and, as a result, a different smart contract address.

For clarity, define the Fireworks instances (different `state_init`) by ID with the following names:

- **1 - Fireworks Setter**: The entity that spreads different launch opcodes. It can be extended to support up to four different opcodes.
- **2 - Fireworks Launcher-1**: The Fireworks instance that launches the first fireworks, meaning messages will be sent to the launcher.
- **3 - Fireworks Launcher-2**: The Fireworks instance that launches the second fireworks, meaning messages will be sent to the launcher.

<details>  
    <summary>Expand details on transactions</summary>

**Index** refers to the ID of a transaction in the `launchResult` array.

- **0**: External request to the treasury (the Launcher) that results in an outbound message `op::set_first` with 2.5 TON to Fireworks.
- **1**: The transaction in the Fireworks Setter contract invoked with `op::set_first`, executing two outbound messages to Fireworks Launcher-1 and Fireworks Launcher-2.
- **2**: The transaction in Fireworks Launcher-1 invoked with `op::launch_first`, executing four outbound messages to the Launcher.
- **3**: The transaction in Fireworks Launcher-2 invoked with `op::launch_second`, executing one outbound message to the Launcher.
- **4**: Transaction in the Launcher with an incoming message from Fireworks Launcher-1. This message is sent with `send mode = 0`.
- **5**: Transaction in the Launcher with an incoming message from Fireworks Launcher-1. This message is sent with `send mode = 1`.
- **6**: Transaction in the Launcher with an incoming message from Fireworks Launcher-1. This message is sent with `send mode = 2`.
- **7**: Transaction in the Launcher with an incoming message from Fireworks Launcher-1. This message is sent with `send mode = 128 + 32`.
- **8**: Transaction in the Launcher with an incoming message from Fireworks Launcher-2. This message is sent with `send mode = 64`.

</details>

Each "firework" is an outbound message with a unique message body, appearing in transactions with IDs 3 and 4.

Below is a list of tests for each transaction expected to execute successfully.

### Transaction ID:1 success test

[This test](https://github.com/ton-community/fireworks-func/blob/main/tests/Fireworks.spec.ts#L75) checks if the fireworks are successfully set by sending a transaction with a value of 2.5 TON.  
This is the simplest case, where the main purpose is to assert that the `success` property of the transaction result is `true`.

To filter a specific transaction from the `launchResult.transactions` array, you can use the most convenient fields: `from` (contract sender address), `to` (contract destination address), and `op` (opcode value). This combination retrieves only one transaction.

  }}
/>
<br></br>
The transaction[ID:1] in the Fireworks Setter contract is invoked with `op::set_first`
and executes two outbound messages to Fireworks Launcher-1 and Fireworks Launcher-2.{" "}

```typescript
it("first transaction[ID:1] should set fireworks successfully", async () => {
  const launcher = await blockchain.treasury("launcher");
  const launchResult = await fireworks.sendDeployLaunch(
    launcher.getSender(),
    toNano("2.5")
  );

  expect(launchResult.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
    from: launcher.address,
    to: fireworks.address,
    success: true,
    op: Opcodes.set_first,
  });
});
```

### Transaction ID:2 success test

[This test](https://github.com/ton-community/fireworks-func/blob/main/tests/Fireworks.spec.ts#L92) checks if transaction[ID:2] executes successfully.

<br></br>
<ThemedImage
  alt=""
  sources={{

      "/img/docs/writing-test-examples/test-examples-schemes_id2.svg?raw=true",
    dark: "/img/docs/writing-test-examples/test-examples-schemes_id2_dark.svg?raw=true",
  }}
/>
<br></br>
The transaction in Fireworks Launcher-1 is invoked with `op::launch_first` and executes
four outbound messages to the Launcher.{" "}

```typescript
it("should exist a transaction[ID:2] which launches first fireworks successfully", async () => {
  const launcher = await blockchain.treasury("launcher");
  const launchResult = await fireworks.sendDeployLaunch(
    launcher.getSender(),
    toNano("2.5")
  );

  expect(launchResult.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
    from: fireworks.address,
    to: launched_f1.address,
    success: true,
    op: Opcodes.launch_first,
    outMessagesCount: 4,
    destroyed: true,
    endStatus: "non-existing",
  });

  printTransactionFees(launchResult.transactions);
});
```

When a transaction affects the state of a contract, you can specify this using the `destroyed` and `endStatus` fields.

The full list of account status-related fields includes:

- **`destroyed`**: `true` if the existing contract was destroyed due to executing a certain transaction. Otherwise, `false`.
- **`deploy`**: Custom Sandbox flag that indicates whether the contract was deployed during this transaction. `true` if the contract was not initialized before this transaction and became initialized afterward. Otherwise, `false`.
- **`oldStatus`**: AccountStatus before transaction execution. Values: `'uninitialized'`, `'frozen'`, `'active'`, `'non-existing'`.
- **`endStatus`**: AccountStatus after transaction execution. Values: `'uninitialized'`, `'frozen'`, `'active'`, `'non-existing'`.

### Transaction ID:3 success test

      .endCell(), // 0x00000000 comment opcode and encoded comment
  });
});
```

## Printing and reading transaction fees

During testing, reading details about fees can help optimize the contract. The `printTransactionFees` function prints the entire transaction chain in a convenient format.

```typescript
it("should execute and print fees", async () => {
  const launcher = await blockchain.treasury("launcher");
  const launchResult = await fireworks.sendDeployLaunch(
    launcher.getSender(),
    toNano("2.5")
  );

  console.log(printTransactionFees(launchResult.transactions));
});
```

For instance, in the case of `launchResult`, the following table will be printed:

| (index) | op           | valueIn        | valueOut       | totalFees      | outActions |
| ------- | ------------ | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| 0       | 'N/A'        | 'N/A'          | '2.5 TON'      | '0.010605 TON' | 1          |
| 1       | '0x5720cfeb' | '2.5 TON'      | '2.185812 TON' | '0.015836 TON' | 2          |
| 2       | '0x6efe144b' | '1.092906 TON' | '1.081142 TON' | '0.009098 TON' | 4          |
| 3       | '0xa2e2c2dc' | '1.092906 TON' | '1.088638 TON' | '0.003602 TON' | 1          |
| 4       | '0x0'        | '0.099 TON'    | '0 TON'        | '0.000309 TON' | 0          |
| 5       | '0x0'        | '0.1 TON'      | '0 TON'        | '0.000309 TON' | 0          |
| 6       | '0x0'        | '0.099 TON'    | '0 TON'        | '0.000309 TON' | 0          |
| 7       | '0x0'        | '0.783142 TON' | '0 TON'        | '0.000309 TON' | 0          |
| 8       | '0x0'        | '1.088638 TON' | '0 TON'        | '0.000309 TON' | 0          |

![](/img/docs/writing-test-examples/fireworks_trace_tonviewer.png?=RAW)

**Index** refers to the ID of a transaction in the `launchResult` array.

- **0**: External request to the treasury (the Launcher) that results in a message `op::set_first` to Fireworks.
- **1**: The Fireworks transaction that results in four messages to the Launcher.
- **2**: Transaction on Launched Fireworks-1 from the Launcher, with a message sent using the `op::launch_first` opcode.
- **3**: Transaction on Launched Fireworks-2 from the Launcher, with a message sent using the `op::launch_second` opcode.
- **4**: Transaction on the Launcher with an incoming message from Launched Fireworks-1, sent with `send mode = 0`.
- **5**: Transaction on the Launcher with an incoming message from Launched Fireworks-1, sent with `send mode = 1`.
- **6**: Transaction on the Launcher with an incoming message from Launched Fireworks-1, sent with `send mode = 2`.
- **7**: Transaction on the Launcher with an incoming message from Launched Fireworks-1, sent with `send mode = 128 + 32`.
- **8**: Transaction on the Launcher with an incoming message from Launched Fireworks-2, sent with `send mode = 64`.

## Transaction fees tests

This test verifies whether the transaction fees for launching the fireworks are as expected. You can define custom assertions for different parts of the commission fees.

```typescript
it("should execute with expected fees", async () => {
  const launcher = await blockchain.treasury("launcher");
  const launchResult = await fireworks.sendDeployLaunch(
    launcher.getSender(),
    toNano("2.5")
  );

  // Total fee
  console.log("total fees = ", launchResult.transactions[1].totalFees);

  const tx1 = launchResult.transactions[1];
  if (tx1.description.type !== "generic") {
    throw new Error("Generic transaction expected");
  }

  // Compute fee
  const computeFee =
    tx1.description.computePhase.type === "vm"
      ? tx1.description.computePhase.gasFees
      : undefined;
  console.log("computeFee = ", computeFee);

  // Action fee
  const actionFee = tx1.description.actionPhase?.totalActionFees;
  console.log("actionFee = ", actionFee);

  if (computeFee == null || undefined || actionFee == null || undefined) {
    throw new Error("undefined fees");
  }

  // Check if Compute Phase and Action Phase fees exceed 1 TON
  expect(computeFee + actionFee).toBeLessThan(toNano("1"));
});
```

## Edge cases tests

This section provides test cases for TVM exit [codes](/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-exit-codes) that can occur during transaction processing. These exit codes are part of the blockchain code itself. It is necessary to distinguish between exit codes during the [Compute Phase](/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-overview#compute-phase) and the Action Phase.

During the Compute Phase, the contract logic (its code) is executed. While processing, various actions can be created. These actions are processed in the next phase—the Action Phase. If the Compute Phase is unsuccessful, the Action Phase does not start. However, a successful Compute Phase does not guarantee that the Action Phase will also succeed.

### Compute Phase | exit code = 0

This exit code indicates that the Compute Phase of the transaction completed successfully.

### Compute Phase | exit code = 1

An alternative exit code for denoting the success of the Compute Phase is `1`. To trigger this exit code, use the [RETALT](https://github.com/ton-community/fireworks-func/blob/ef49b4da12d287a8f6c2b6f0c19d65814c1578fc/contracts/fireworks.fc#L20) opcode.

Note that this opcode must be called in the main function (e.g., `recv_internal`). If called in another function, the exit from that function will be `1`, but the total exit code will be `0`.

### Compute Phase | exit code = 2

TVM is a [stack machine](/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-overview#tvm-is-a-stack-machine). When interacting with different values, they are placed on the stack. If there are no elements on the stack when an opcode requires them, this error is thrown.

This can occur when working directly with opcodes, as [stdlib.fc](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/master/crypto/smartcont/stdlib.fc) (a library for FunC) assumes this problem will not arise.

### Compute Phase | exit code = 3

Any code before execution becomes a `continuation`. This is a special data type containing a slice with code, a stack, registers, and other data necessary for code execution. Such a continuation can be run later if needed, passing the required parameters for the initial state of the stack.

First, we [build](https://github.com/ton-community/fireworks-func/blob/ef49b4da12d287a8f6c2b6f0c19d65814c1578fc/contracts/fireworks.fc#L31-L32) such a continuation. In this case, it is an empty continuation that does nothing. Next, using the opcode `0 SETNUMARGS`, we indicate that no values should be on the stack at the start of execution. Then, using the opcode `1 -1 SETCONTARGS`, we call the continuation, passing one value. Since there should have been no values, we get a StackOverflow error.

### Compute Phase | exit code = 4

In TVM, `integer` values can range from -2<sup>256</sup> < x < 2<sup>256</sup>. If a value exceeds this range during calculation, exit code 4 is thrown.

### Compute Phase | exit code = 5

If an `integer` value exceeds the expected range, exit code 5 is thrown. For example, if a negative value is used in the `.store_uint()` function.

### Compute Phase | exit code = 6

At a lower level, opcodes are used instead of familiar function names. These opcodes can be seen in [this table](/v3/documentation/tvm/instructions) in HEX form. In this example, we [use](https://github.com/ton-community/fireworks-func/blob/ef49b4da12d287a8f6c2b6f0c19d65814c1578fc/contracts/fireworks.fc#L25) `@addop`, which adds a non-existent opcode.

The emulator, when attempting to process this opcode, does not recognize it and throws exit code 6.

### Compute Phase | exit code = 7

This is a common error that occurs when receiving the wrong data type. In this [example](https://github.com/ton-community/fireworks-func/blob/ef49b4da12d287a8f6c2b6f0c19d65814c1578fc/contracts/fireworks.fc#L79-L80), the `tuple` contained three elements, but an attempt was made to unpack four.

There are many other cases where this error is thrown, such as:

- [Not a null](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/9728bc65b75defe4f9dcaaea0f62a22f198abe96/crypto/vm/stack.cpp#L433)

### Compute Phase | exit code = 8

All data in TON is stored in [cells](/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/cell-boc#cell). A cell can store up to 1023 bits of data and four references to other cells. If you attempt to write more than 1023 bits or more than four references, exit code 8 is thrown.

### Compute Phase | exit code = 9

If you attempt to read more data from a slice (when reading data from a cell, it must be converted to a slice data type) than it contains, exit code 9 is thrown. For example, if there are 10 bits in the slice and 11 are read, or if there are no references but an attempt is made to load a reference.

### Compute Phase | exit code = 10

This error is thrown when working with [dictionaries](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/func/docs/stdlib/#dictionaries-primitives). For example, if the value associated with a key [is stored in another cell](https://github.com/ton-community/fireworks-func/blob/ef49b4da12d287a8f6c2b6f0c19d65814c1578fc/contracts/fireworks.fc#L100-L110) as a reference, you must use the `.udict_get_ref()` function to retrieve the value.

However, the reference to another cell [should only be one](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/9728bc65b75defe4f9dcaaea0f62a22f198abe96/crypto/vm/dict.cpp#L454), not two, as in this example:

```
root_cell
├── key
│   ├── value
│   └── value - second reference for one key
└── key
    └── value
```

This is why attempting to read the value results in exit code 10.

**Additional:** You can also store the value next to the key in the dictionary:

```
root_cell
├── key-value
└── key-value
```

**Note:** The actual structure of the dictionary (how data is located in cells) is more complex than shown in the examples above. These examples are simplified for clarity.

### Compute Phase | exit code = 11

This error occurs when something unknown happens. For example, when using the [SENDMSG](/v3/documentation/tvm/changelog/tvm-upgrade-2023-07#sending-messages) opcode, if you pass the [wrong](https://github.com/ton-community/fireworks-func/blob/ef49b4da12d287a8f6c2b6f0c19d65814c1578fc/contracts/fireworks.fc#L116) (e.g., empty) cell with a message, this error occurs.

It also occurs when attempting to call a non-existent method. Developers often encounter this when calling a non-existent GET method.

### Compute Phase | exit code = -14 (13)

If there is not enough TON to handle the Compute Phase, this error is thrown. In the `Excno` enum class, where exit codes for various Compute Phase errors are defined, [the value 13 is indicated](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/9728bc65b75defe4f9dcaaea0f62a22f198abe96/crypto/vm/excno.hpp#L39).

However, during processing, the [NOT operation is applied](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/9728bc65b75defe4f9dcaaea0f62a22f198abe96/crypto/block/transaction.cpp#L1574) to this value, changing it to `-14`. This ensures that this exit code cannot be faked using, for example, the `throw` function, as such functions only accept positive values for exit codes.

### Action Phase | exit code = 32

The Action Phase begins after the Compute Phase and processes actions written to [register c5](/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-initialization#control-register-c5) during the Compute Phase. If the data in this register is incorrectly written, exit code 32 is thrown.

### Action Phase | exit code = 33

Currently, a maximum of `255` actions can be included in one transaction. If this limit is exceeded, the Action Phase ends with exit code 33.

### Action Phase | exit code = 34

This exit code covers most errors when working with actions, such as invalid messages or incorrect actions.

### Action Phase | exit code = 35

When building the [CommonMsgInfo](/v3/guidelines/smart-contracts/howto/wallet#commonmsginfo) part of a message, you must specify the correct source address. It must be either [addr_none](/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/msg-tlb#addr_none00) or the address of the account sending the message.

In the blockchain code, this is handled by [check_replace_src_addr](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/9728bc65b75defe4f9dcaaea0f62a22f198abe96/crypto/block/transaction.cpp#L1985).

### Action Phase | exit code = 36

If the destination address is invalid, exit code 36 is thrown. Possible reasons include a non-existent workchain or an incorrect address. All checks can be seen in [check_rewrite_dest_addr](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/9728bc65b75defe4f9dcaaea0f62a22f198abe96/crypto/block/transaction.cpp#L2014-L2113).

### Action Phase | exit code = 37

This exit code is similar to `-14` in the Compute Phase. It indicates insufficient balance to send the specified amount of TON.

### Action Phase | exit code = 38

This is similar to exit code `37` but refers to insufficient [ExtraCurrency](/v3/documentation/infra/minter-flow#extracurrency) balance.

### Action Phase | exit code = 40

If there is enough TON to process part of a message (e.g., 5 cells) but the message contains 10 cells, exit code 40 is thrown.

### Action Phase | exit code = 43

This error may occur if the maximum number of cells in the library is exceeded or the maximum depth of the Merkle tree is exceeded.

A library is a cell stored in [Masterchain](/v3/concepts/dive-into-ton/ton-blockchain/blockchain-of-blockchains#masterchain-blockchain-of-blockchains) and can be used by all smart contracts if it is [public](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/9728bc65b75defe4f9dcaaea0f62a22f198abe96/crypto/block/transaction.cpp#L1844).
