# Things to focus on while working with TON Blockchain

In this article, we will review and discuss the elements to consider for those who want to develop TON applications.

## Checklist

### 1. Name collisions

FunC variables and functions may contain almost any legit character. i.e. `var++`, `~bits`, `foo-bar+baz` including commas are valid variables and functions names.

When writing and inspecting a Func code, Linter should be used.

- [IDE plugins](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/getting-started/ide-plugins)

### 2. Check the throw values

Each time the TVM execution stops normally, it stops with exit codes `0` or `1`. Although it is done automatically, TVM execution can be interrupted directly in an unexpected way if exit codes `0` and `1` are thrown directly by either `throw(0)` or `throw(1)` command.

- [How to handle errors](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/func/docs/builtins#throwing-exceptions)
- [TVM exit codes](/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-exit-codes)

### 3. FunC is a strictly typed language with data structures holding exactly what they are supposed to store

It is crucial to keep track of what the code does and what it may return. Keep in mind that the compiler cares only about the code and only in its initial state. After certain operations stored values of some variables can change.

Reading unexpected variables values and calling methods on data types that are not supposed to have such methods (or their return values are not stored properly) are errors and are not skipped as "warnings" or "notices" but lead to unreachable code. Keep in mind that storing an unexpected value may be okay, however, reading it may cause problems, e.g., error code 5 (integer out of expected range) may be thrown for an integer variable.

### 4. Messages have modes

It is essential to check the message mode, in particular its interaction with previous messages sent and fees. A possible failure is not accounting for storage fees, in which case the contract may run out of TON, leading to unexpected failures when sending outgoing messages. You can view the message modes [here](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/message-management/sending-messages#message-modes).

### 5. Replay protection \{#replay-protection}

There are two custom solutions for wallets (smart contracts that store user funds): `seqno-based` (using a counter to prevent processing the same message twice) and `high-load` (storing processed identifiers and their expiration times).

- [Seqno-based wallets](/v3/guidelines/dapps/asset-processing/payments-processing/#seqno-based-wallets)
- [High-load wallets](/v3/guidelines/dapps/asset-processing/payments-processing/#high-load-wallets)

For `seqno`, refer to [this section](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/message-management/sending-messages#mode3) for details on possible replay scenarios.

### 6. TON fully implements the actor model

It means the code of the contract can be changed. It can either be changed permanently, using [`SETCODE`](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/func/docs/stdlib#set_code) TVM directive, or in runtime, setting the TVM code registry to a new cell value until the end of execution.

### 7. TON Blockchain has several transaction phases: compute phase, action phase, including a bounce phase

The compute phase executes the code of smart contracts and only then the actions are performed (sending messages, code modification, changing libraries, and others). Unlike on Ethereum-based blockchains, a sent message may fail during the action phase while the compute phase still exits successfully; such a failure is reflected in the action phase result, not in the compute phase exit code.

- [Transactions and phases](/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-overview#transactions-and-phases)

### 8. TON contracts are autonomous

Contracts in the blockchain can reside in separate shards, processed by other set of validators, meaning that developer cannot pull data from other contracts on demand. Thus, any communication is asynchronous and done by sending messages.

- [Sending messages from smart contract](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/message-management/sending-messages)
- [Sending messages from DApp](/v3/guidelines/ton-connect/cookbook/ton-transfer)

### 9. Unlike other blockchains, TON does not include revert messages; outcomes are indicated by exit codes

It is helpful to think through the roadmap of exit codes for the code flow (and have it documented) before starting programming your TON smart contract.

### 10. FunC functions that have method_id identifiers have method IDs

They can be either set explicitly `method_id(5)`, or implicitly by the FunC compiler. In this case, they can be found among method declarations in the Fift assembly (.fif) file. Two of them are predefined: `recv_internal` = 0 (receiving messages inside the blockchain) and `recv_external` = -1 (receiving messages from outside).

### 11. TON crypto address may not have any coins or code

Smart contracts addresses in TON blockchain are deterministic and can be precomputed. Ton Accounts, associated with addresses may even contain no code which means they are uninitialized (if not deployed) or frozen while having no more storage or TON coins if the message with special flags was sent.

### 12. TON addresses have two standard representations

A full representation can either be "raw" (`workchain:address`) or "user-friendly". The latter is the one users encounter most often. It contains a tag byte (e.g., bounceable, testnet, checksum) and a workchain ID byte. For full definitions of user-friendly flags, refer to the Address formats page below.

- [Raw and user-friendly addresses](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/addresses/address-formats)

### 13. Keep track of the flaws in code execution

Unlike Solidity where it's up to you to set methods visibility, in the case of FunC, the visibility is restricted in a more intricate way either by showing errors or by `if` statements.

### 14. Keep an eye on gas fees before sending bounced messages

In case the smart contract sends the bounced messages with the value, provided by a user, make sure that the corresponding gas fees are subtracted from the returned amount not to be drained.

### 15. Monitor the callbacks and their failures

TON blockchain is asynchronous. That means the messages do not have to arrive successively. e.g. when a fail notification of an action arrives, it should be handled properly.

### 16. Check if the bounced flag was sent receiving internal messages

You may receive bounced messages (error notifications), which should be handled.
