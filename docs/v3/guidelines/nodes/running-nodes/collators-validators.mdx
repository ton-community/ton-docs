# Collators and validators in MyTonCtrl


:::caution
Please be aware that collator nodes used by validators should be treated as mission-critical assets, especially if more than one validator utilizes a collator machine. Great care should be taken to ensure the flawless operation and failover of these nodes. Any configuration changes to collators must be thoroughly tested and reviewed before being implemented.
:::

## Collators

### Installation
To install and set up a new node in `collator` mode, you can use the interactive installer:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ton-blockchain/mytonctrl/master/scripts/install.sh
sudo bash install.sh
```
There, you should choose `collator` mode and provide the shards you want to sync and collate blocks for.
In the process of installation, MyTonCtrl will enable `collator` mode, create a specific ADNL address for the collator and
set up the node to monitor specified shards and collate blocks for them.

### Enabling collator on existing node

If you already have an installed MyTonCtrl instance, you can enable `collator` mode by running the following command:

```bash
enable_mode collator
```
Note that to enable `collator` mode, you first have to turn off `validator` or `liteserver` modes if they are enabled.

After this, you can run blocks collation using:

```bash
setup_collator [--adnl <ADNL address>] <shard1> [shard2] ...
```

MyTonCtrl will create an ADNL address for the collator, edit the node configuration to monitor only specified shards and start collating blocks for them.
You can actually specify the ADNL address with the `--adnl` option if you want to use one that already exists in your node configuration.
Example of the command:

```bash
setup_collator --adnl 5889072E81219A0E656F31E8784EA09C93A562AA74308E1B25364EE87EEE6631 0:2000000000000000 0:6000000000000000
```

:::caution
Adding new shards to monitor on an existing node that is already monitoring other shards is not recommended, as it may cause performance issues or unexpected behavior.
When using `setup_collator`, MyTonCtrl checks if the provided shards are already included in the nodes already monitored and raises an error if they are not.
However, it's entirely ok to add new ADNL addresses to the collator to collate blocks for already monitored shards and broadcast them with a different ADNL address.
:::

### Collator actions

#### Print local collators
To print collator addresses and their shards, you can use the following command:

```bash
print_local_collators
```
You will get a table with the collator's addresses and the shards it's collating blocks for.

### Validator whitelist
By default, the collator sends collated blocks to anyone who requests them. Thus, it's a good idea to restrict access to collated blocks to only whitelisted validators.

#### Add validators to collation whitelist
To enable the collation whitelist and add validators to it, you can use the following command:

```bash
add_validator_to_collation_wl <adnl> [adnl2] ...
```

:::note
The `adnl` argument here is the ADNL address of the remote validator, in line with the output of the `status` command on the validator that shows the address in the `ADNL address of local validator` field.
:::

This will enable collation wl and add specified validators to it.

#### Delete validators from whitelist
To remove validators from the collation whitelist, use:

```bash
delete_validator_from_collation_wl <adnl> [adnl2] ...
```

This command removes the specified ADNL addresses from the collation whitelist. The validators with these addresses will no longer be able to receive collated blocks from this collator.

#### Disable collation whitelist
To altogether turn off the collation whitelist and allow any validator to receive collated blocks:

```bash
disable_collation_wl
```

This command turns off the whitelist functionality, reverting the collator to its default behavior of sending blocks to any requesting validator.

#### Print collation whitelist
To view the current collation whitelist and see which validators are allowed to receive collated blocks:

```bash
print_collation_whitelist
```

This command displays the current state of the collation whitelist, showing all whitelisted validator ADNL addresses and whether the whitelist is currently enabled.

### Stopping collator

:::caution
It is highly not recommended to reuse a collator node as a validator after it was used as a collator, as it may
not sync the whole blockchain and miss the creation of blocks for some shards. So it is recommended to uninstall MyTonCtrl
and then install it again in `validator` mode.
:::

To stop the collator, you can use the command:

```bash
stop_collator <adnl> <shard>
```

Or to stop all collators on the node, you can use the same command without parameters:

```bash
stop_collator
```


## Validators

In both cases, when you installed collator from scratch or enabled it on an existing node, MyTonCtrl will print in the logs the command to add this collator to your validator node:

```
...
To add this collator to the validator, use the command:
`add_collator 5889072E81219A0E656F31E8784EA09C93A562AA74308E1B25364EE87EEE6631 0:4000000000000000`
setup_collator - OK
```
You can still access these params using `print_local_collators` on the collator node.


### Adding collators to validator

To enable the validator to use external collators for block production, you need to add collator configurations to the validator node.

```bash
add_collator <adnl> <shard> [--self-collate <true/false>] [--select-mode <random/ordered/round_robin>]
```

Where:
- `<shard>` - The shard identifier (e.g., `0:4000000000000000`)
- `<adnl>` - The ADNL address of the collator node
- `--self-collate` - Whether the validator should also collate blocks itself in addition to using external collators (default is `true`)
- `true` - Validator will collate blocks locally in case none of the added collators are available
- `false` - Validator will only use external collators
- `--select-mode` - How to choose between multiple available collators (default is `random`)
- `random` - Select online collators randomly
- `ordered` - Select collators in the order they were added, falling back to the next if unavailable
- `round_robin` - Cycle through collators sequentially

:::note
The `--self-collate` and `--select-mode` options apply to all collators for the specified shard.
If these options are already configured for that shard, they will be overridden.
:::

### Managing validator collators

#### View configured collators
To see which collators are currently configured on the validator:

```bash
print_collators
```
You can add flag `--json` to get output in JSON ValidatorConsole-friendly format.

#### Remove collator
To remove a collator from the validator configuration:

```bash
delete_collator [shard] <adnl>
```
If a shard is provided, the collator with the specified ADNL address will be removed only for that shard.
Otherwise, the collator will be removed from all shards to which it was added.
If all collators for a shard are removed, the shard will be removed from the configuration.

#### Reset all collators
To turn off using collators on the validator, use the command:

```bash
reset_collators
```
