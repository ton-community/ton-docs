# Security Guidelines for Nodes

Ensuring the security of nodes, particularly in decentralized networks such as blockchain or distributed systems, is essential for maintaining data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. The guidelines for securing nodes should cover several layers, including network communication, hardware, and software configurations. Below is a set of guidelines to enhance node security:

### 1. Use the server exclusively to operate the node

- Using the server for additional tasks presents a potential security risk.

### 2. Update and patch regularly

- Keep your system updated with the latest security patches.

- Regularly use package management tools like apt (Debian/Ubuntu) or yum/dnf (CentOS/Fedora) to perform updates.

  ```bash
  # Debian/Ubuntu
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

  # CentOS
  sudo yum update -y

  # Fedora
  sudo dnf upgrade -y
  ```

- Consider automating security updates by enabling unattended upgrades for your system.

### 3. Ensure a robust SSH configuration

- **Disable root login:** Prevent root access through SSH by editing the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file.

  ```conf
  PermitRootLogin no
  ```
- **Use SSH keys:** For a more secure connection, opt for SSH keys instead of password authentication.
  ```conf
  PasswordAuthentication no
  ```
- **Modify the default SSH port:** Changing the default SSH port can help reduce automated brute-force attacks:

  ```conf
  Port 2222
  ```
- After editing `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, apply changes with `sudo systemctl reload ssh` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `sudo systemctl reload sshd` (RHEL/CentOS/Fedora).

:::caution
Before disabling password authentication or changing the SSH port, ensure you can sign in with SSH keys and that firewall rules allow the new port to avoid lockout.
:::
- **Restrict SSH access:** Allow SSH connections only from trusted IP addresses by implementing firewall rules.

### 4. Implement a firewall

- Set up a firewall to permit only essential services. Common tools are **ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall)** and **iptables**:

  ```bash
  sudo ufw allow 22/tcp # Allow SSH
  sudo ufw allow 80/tcp # Allow HTTP
  sudo ufw allow 443/tcp # Allow HTTPS
  sudo ufw default deny incoming
  sudo ufw default allow outgoing
  sudo ufw enable # Enable firewall
  ```

- Note: Replace `22` with your configured SSH port (e.g., `2222`). Also, if running a full node, ensure the required UDP port is allowed/forwarded. See `guidelines/nodes/running-nodes/full-node.mdx#port-forwarding`.

### 5. Monitor logs

- Regularly monitor system logs to detect suspicious activities:
  - `/var/log/auth.log` (authentication attempts on Debian/Ubuntu)
  - `/var/log/secure` (authentication attempts on RHEL/CentOS)
  - `/var/log/syslog` or `/var/log/messages`
- Consider implementing centralized logging.

### 6. Limit user privileges

- Grant root or sudo privileges only to trusted users. Use the sudo command carefully and use `visudo` to audit/edit the `/etc/sudoers` file to limit access.

- Regularly review user accounts and remove any unnecessary or inactive users.

### 7. Utilize SELinux or AppArmor

- **SELinux** (on RHEL/CentOS/Fedora) and **AppArmor** (on Ubuntu/Debian) provide mandatory access control, adding an extra layer of security by restricting programs from accessing specific system resources.

### 8. Install security tools

- Utilize tools such as **Lynis** to conduct regular security audits and identify potential vulnerabilities:

  ```bash
  # Debian/Ubuntu
  sudo apt install lynis -y

  # RHEL/CentOS/Fedora
  sudo dnf install lynis -y

  # Run audit
  sudo lynis audit system
  ```

### 9. Disable unnecessary services

- To minimize the attack surface, disable or remove any unused services. For instance, if FTP or mail services are not needed, ensure you disable them:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl disable <service_name>
  ```

### 10. Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS)

- Use tools like **Fail2ban** to block IP addresses after multiple failed login attempts:

  ```bash
  # Debian/Ubuntu
  sudo apt install fail2ban -y

  # RHEL/CentOS/Fedora
  sudo dnf install fail2ban -y
  ```

- Utilize **AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment)** to monitor file integrity and identify any unauthorized changes.

### Unattended updates

- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install unattended-upgrades`
- RHEL/Fedora: `sudo dnf install dnf-automatic -y && sudo systemctl enable --now dnf-automatic.timer`

:::caution
Please remain vigilant and ensure that your node is secure at all times.
