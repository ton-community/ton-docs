# Full node

## OS requirements

We highly recommend installing MyTonCtrl using the supported operating systems:

- Ubuntu 20.04
- Ubuntu 22.04
- Debian 11

## Hardware requirements

:::caution Node usage on personal local machine
You shouldn't run any type of node on your personal local machine for extended periods, even if it meets the requirements. Nodes actively use disks, which can lead to rapid wear and potential damage.
:::

### With validator

- 16 cores CPU
- 128 GB RAM
- 1TB NVME SSD _OR_ Provisioned 64+k IOPS storage
- 1 Gbit/s network connectivity
- Public IP address (_fixed IP address_)
- 64 TB/month traffic (100 TB/month on peak load)

:::info Be ready for peak loads
To reliably handle peak loads, a connection of at least 1 Gbit/s is typically required, while the average load is expected to be around 100 Mbit/s.
:::

### Port forwarding

All types of nodes require a static external IP address, one UDP port forwarded for incoming connections, and all outgoing connections to be open—the node uses random ports for new outgoing connections. The node must also be visible to the outside world over the NAT.

You can accomplish this by contacting your network provider or [renting a server](/v3/guidelines/nodes/running-nodes/full-node#recommended-providers) to run a node.

:::info
You can find out which UDP port is open using the `netstat -tulpn` command.

### Recommended providers

The TON Foundation recommends the following providers for running a Validator:

## Run a node (text)

### Switch to non-root user

:::warning
This step is required to successfully install and use MyTonCtrl—don't ignore non-root user creation. Without this step, there will be no errors during installation, but MyTonCtrl will not work properly.
:::

If you don't have a non-root user, you can create one with the following steps (otherwise, skip the first two steps and go to the third).

1. Login as root and create new user:

```bash
sudo adduser <username>
```

2. Add your user to the sudo group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo <username>
```

3. Log into the new user (if you are using ssh, **you will need to stop current session and reconnect with correct user**)

```bash
ssh <username>@<server-ip-address>
```

### Install the MyTonCtrl

Download and run the installation script from the **non-root** user account with **sudo** privileges:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="ubuntu" label="Ubuntu">

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ton-blockchain/mytonctrl/master/scripts/install.sh
sudo bash install.sh
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value={'debian'} label={'Debian'}>

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ton-blockchain/mytonctrl/master/scripts/install.sh
su root -c 'bash install.sh'
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

- `-d` - **mytonctrl** will download a [dump](https://dump.ton.org/) of the latest blockchain state.
  This will reduce synchronization time by several times.
- `-c <path>` - If you want to use not public liteservers for synchronization. _(not required)_
- `-i` - Ignore minimum requirements, use it only if you want to check compilation process without real node usage.
- `-m` - Mode, can be `validator` or `liteserver`.
- `-t` - Disable telemetry.

**To use testnet**, `-c` flag should be provided with `https://ton.org/testnet-global.config.json` value.

Default `-c` flag value is `https://ton-blockchain.github.io/global.config.json`, which is default mainnet config.

### Running the MyTonCtrl

1. Run `MyTonCtrl` console **from the local user account used for installation**:

```sh
mytonctrl
```

2. Check the `MyTonCtrl` status using the `status` command:

```sh
status
```

**In testnet** `status fast` command must be used instead of `status`.

The following statuses should be displayed:

- **mytoncore status**: should display in green.
- **local validator status**: should also display in green.
- **local validator out of sync**: initially, a `n/a` string is displayed. As soon as the newly created validator connects with other validators, the number will be around 250k. As synchronization progresses, this number decreases. When it falls below 20, the validator is synchronized.

Example of the **status** command output:

![status](/img/docs/nodes-validator/mytonctrl-status.png)

:::caution Make sure you have same output for status
For all nodes type **Local Validator status** section should appear.
Otherwise, [check troubleshooting section](/v3/guidelines/nodes/nodes-troubleshooting#status-command-displays-without-local-node-section) and [check node logs](/v3/guidelines/nodes/running-nodes/full-node#check-the-node-logs).
:::

Please wait until the `Local validator out of sync` status is less than 20 seconds.

When a new node is started, even from a dump, it is important to wait up to 3 hours before the _out of sync_ number begins to decrease. This delay occurs because the node must establish its place in the network and propagate its addresses through the DHT tables, among other processes.

### Uninstall mytonctrl

Download script and run it:

```bash
sudo bash /usr/src/mytonctrl/scripts/uninstall.sh
```

### Check mytonctrl owner

Run:

```bash
ls -lh /var/ton-work/keys/
```

## Tips & tricks

### List of available commands

- You can use `help` to get a list of available commands:

![Help command](/img/docs/full-node/help.jpg)

### Check the MyTonCtrl logs

- To check **MyTonCtrl** logs, open `~/.local/share/mytoncore/mytoncore.log` for a local user or `/usr/local/bin/mytoncore/mytoncore.log` for root.

![logs](/img/docs/nodes-validator/manual-ubuntu_mytoncore-log.png)

### Check the node logs

Check the node logs in case of failure:

```bash
tail -f /var/ton-work/log.thread*
```
