# Full Node

## OS requirements

We highly recommend installing MyTonCtrl on the following supported operating systems:

- Ubuntu 20.04
- Ubuntu 22.04
- Debian 11

## Hardware requirements

:::caution Node usage on personal local machine
You shouldn't run any type of node on your personal local machine for extended periods, even if it meets the requirements. Nodes actively use disks, which can lead to rapid wear and potential damage.
:::

### Validator hardware requirements

- 16 cores CPU
- 128 GB RAM
- 1TB NVMe SSD or provisioned 64k+ IOPS storage
- 1 Gbps network connectivity
- Public, static IP address
- 64 TB/month traffic (100 TB/month at peak load)

:::info Be ready for peak loads
To reliably handle peak loads, a connection of at least 1 Gbps is typically required, while the average load is expected to be around 100 Mbit/s.
:::

### Port forwarding

All types of nodes require a static external IP address, one UDP port forwarded for incoming connections, and all outgoing connections to be open—the node uses random ports for new outgoing connections. The node must also be reachable from the public internet when it is behind a NAT.

You can accomplish this by contacting your network provider or [renting a server](/v3/guidelines/nodes/running-nodes/full-node#recommended-providers) to run a node.

:::info
`netstat` and `ss` list local listeners only. To list UDP listeners, use `ss -u -lpn` (or `netstat -u -lpn`). To confirm public reachability, verify firewall/NAT rules or use an external port check.
:::

### Recommended providers

The TON Foundation recommends the following providers for running a validator:

| Cloud Provider | Instance Type                   | CPU                     | RAM     | Storage                           | Network         | Public IP                               | Traffic       |

## Run a node (text)

### Switch to non-root user

:::warning
This step is required to successfully install and use MyTonCtrl—don't ignore non-root user creation. Without this step, there will be no errors during installation, but MyTonCtrl will not work properly.
:::

If you don't have a non-root user, you can create one with the following steps (otherwise, skip the first two steps and go to the third).

1. Log in as root and create a new user:

```bash
adduser <username>
```

2. Add your user to the sudo group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo <username>
```

3. Log in as the new user (If you use SSH, stop the current session and reconnect as the correct user.)

```bash
ssh <username>@<server-ip-address>
```

### Install MyTonCtrl

Download and run the installation script from the **non-root** user account with **sudo** privileges:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="ubuntu" label="Ubuntu">

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ton-blockchain/mytonctrl/master/scripts/install.sh
sudo bash install.sh
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value={'debian'} label={'Debian'}>

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ton-blockchain/mytonctrl/master/scripts/install.sh
sudo bash install.sh
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

- `-d` - **mytonctrl** will download a [dump](https://dump.ton.org/) of the latest blockchain state.
  This significantly reduces synchronization time.
- `-c <path>` - If you want to use a non-public liteserver for synchronization. _(not required)_
- `-i` - Ignore the minimum requirements, use it only if you want to check the compilation process without real node usage.
- `-m` - Mode, can be `validator` or `liteserver`.
- `-t` - Disable telemetry.

To use testnet, provide the `-c` flag with `https://ton.org/testnet-global.config.json`. The default `-c` value is `https://ton-blockchain.github.io/global.config.json` (mainnet).

### Run MyTonCtrl

1. Open the MyTonCtrl console **from the local user account used for installation**:

```sh
mytonctrl
```

2. Check the `MyTonCtrl` status using the `status` command:

```
status
```

In testnet, use the `status fast` command instead of `status`.

The following statuses should be displayed:

- **mytoncore status**: should display in green.
- **local validator status**: should also display in green.
- **local validator out of sync**: initially, n/a is displayed. As synchronization progresses, this number decreases. When it falls below 20 seconds, the validator is synchronized.

Example of the **status** command output:

![status](/img/docs/nodes-validator/mytonctrl-status.png)

:::caution Make sure you have the same output for status
For all node types, the 'Local validator status' section should appear.
Otherwise, [check the troubleshooting section](/v3/guidelines/nodes/nodes-troubleshooting#status-command-displays-without-local-node-section) and [check the node logs](/v3/guidelines/nodes/running-nodes/full-node#check-the-node-logs).
:::

Please wait until the `Local validator out of sync` status is less than 20 seconds.

When a new node is started, even from a dump, it is important to wait up to 3 hours before the _out of sync_ number begins to decrease. This delay occurs because the node must establish its place in the network and propagate its addresses through the DHT tables, among other processes.

### Uninstall MyTonCtrl

Run the uninstall script:

```bash
sudo bash /usr/src/mytonctrl/scripts/uninstall.sh
```

### Check MyTonCtrl ownership

Run:

```bash
ls -lh /var/ton-work/keys/
```

## Tips & tricks

### List of available commands

- You can use `help` to get a list of available commands:

![Help command](/img/docs/full-node/help.jpg)

### Check the MyTonCtrl logs

- To check **MyTonCtrl** logs, open `~/.local/share/mytoncore/mytoncore.log` for a local user or `/usr/local/bin/mytoncore/mytoncore.log` for root.

![logs](/img/docs/nodes-validator/manual-ubuntu_mytoncore-log.png)

### Check the node logs

Check the node logs in case of failure:

```bash
tail -f /var/ton-work/log.thread*
```
