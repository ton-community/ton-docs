# Performance monitoring

## Monitoring TON server performance

Tools such as `htop`, `iotop`, `iftop`, `dstat`, and `nmon` are effective for measuring real-time system performance; however, they fall short when it comes to troubleshooting performance issues that have occurred in the past.

This guide recommends using the Linux SAR (System Activity Report) utility for monitoring the performance of TON servers, and it provides an explanation of how to use it effectively.

:::tip
This guideline helps to identify whether your server experiences a resource shortage, not whether the validator engine performs badly.

### Installation

#### SAR Installation

```bash
sudo apt-get install sysstat
```

#### Enable automatic statistics gathering

```bash
sudo sed -i 's/false/true/g' /etc/default/sysstat
```

#### Enable the service

```bash
sudo systemctl enable sysstat sysstat-collect.timer sysstat-summary.timer
```

#### Start the service

```bash
sudo systemctl start sysstat sysstat-collect.timer sysstat-summary.timer
```

### Usage

By default, the SAR gathers statistics every 10 minutes and shows statistics for the current day, starting at midnight. You can check it by running the SAR without parameters:

```bash
sar
```

If you want to see statistics of the previous day or two days before, pass the number as an option:

```bash
sar -1   # previous day
sar -2   # two days ago
```

For the exact date, you should use the f option to point to the `sa` file of a given day within a month. Thus, for the September 23rd it would be:

```bash
sar -f /var/log/sysstat/sa23
```

To identify performance issues, it is essential to run specific SAR reports and analyze their results effectively.

The following list outlines the SAR commands that can be used to gather various system statistics. By combining these commands with the provided options, you can quickly generate reports for the desired date.

### Memory report

```bash
sar -rh
```

The TON validator engine uses the **jemalloc** feature, which allows it to cache a significant amount of data. As a result, the `sar â€”rh` command often returns a low number in the `%memused` column.

Meanwhile, you will typically see a high number in the `kbcached` column. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the low amount of free RAM indicated in the `kbmemfree` column. The key indicator to monitor is the value shown in the `%memused` column.

If the percentage exceeds 90%, you should consider adding more RAM. Additionally, keep an eye on your validator engine to ensure it doesn't stop unexpectedly due to an out-of-memory (OOM) issue. The best way to check for this is to grep the `/var/ton-work/log` file for any **Signal** messages.

**Swap usage:**

```bash
sar -Sh
```

If you notice that a swap is used, you should consider adding more RAM. The general recommendation from the **TON Core Team** is to disable the swap.

### CPU report

```bash
sar -u
```

If your server utilizes CPU on average up to 70% (see the `%user` column), this should be considered as good.

### Disk Usage report

```bash
sar -dh
```

Watch the `%util` column and react accordingly if it stays above 90% for a particular disk.

### Network report

Use the commands :

```bash
sar -n DEV -h
```

or

```bash
sar -n DEV -h --iface=<interface name>
```

if you want to filter results by network interface name.

Check out the result of column `%ifutil` - it shows the usage of your interface considering its maximum link speed.

You can check what speed is supported by your NIC by executing the command below:

```bash
cat /sys/class/net/<interface>/speed
```

:::info
The speed you're experiencing is not what your provider promised you.
:::

Consider upgrading your link speed if `%ifutil` shows above 70% usage or columns `rxkB/s` and `txkB/s` reporting values close to a bandwidth provided by your provider.

### Reporting a performance issue

Before reporting any performance issues, ensure that you meet the minimum requirements for the node. Then, execute the following commands:

To generate today's report, run:

```bash
sar -rudh | cat && sar -n DEV -h --iface=eno1 | cat > report_today.txt
```

For yesterday's report, use the following command:

```bash
sar -rudh -1 | cat && sar -n DEV -h --iface=eno1 -1 | cat > report_yesterday.txt
```

Additionally, stop the TON node and measure your disk I/O and network speed with the command below:

```bash
sudo fio --randrepeat=1 --ioengine=io_uring --direct=1 --gtod_reduce=1 --name=test --filename=/var/ton-work/testfile --bs=4096 --iodepth=1 --size=40G --readwrite=randread --numjobs=1 --group_reporting
```

Look for the value at `read: IOPS=` and include it in your report. A value above **10K IOPS** is considered good.

Check your download and upload speeds using the following command:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sivel/speedtest-cli/master/speedtest.py | python3 -
```

Speeds exceeding **700 Mbit/s** are deemed satisfactory.

When reporting, please send the SAR report, IOPS, and network speed results to [@mytonctrl_help_bot](https://t.me/mytonctrl_help_bot).
