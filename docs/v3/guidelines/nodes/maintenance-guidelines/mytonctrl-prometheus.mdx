# MyTonCtrl Prometheus metrics

MyTonCtrl can be configured to expose Prometheus metrics for monitoring and alerting purposes. 
This guide will walk you through the process of enabling Prometheus metrics in MyTonCtrl.

### Metrics delivery method

Currently, MyTonCtrl can only push metrics to Prometheus because of security reasons. 
So it should be used with the [Prometheus Pushgateway](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway) service.

## Setup

:::caution
For validators it's highly recommended to run Prometheus and Pushgateway on a separate server.
:::

1. Install Pushgateway

    You can install the Pushgateway service by following the instructions in the [official documentation](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway?tab=readme-ov-file#run-it).
    The easiest way to do that is via docker:
  
      ```bash
      docker pull prom/pushgateway
      docker run -d -p 9091:9091 prom/pushgateway
      ```

2. Configure Prometheus

    Create `prometheus.yml` file adding the Pushgateway job to the scrape_configs section. Example of the configuration file:

    ```yaml
    global:
      scrape_interval: 15s
      evaluation_interval: 15s
   
    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: "prometheus"
        static_configs:
          - targets: ["localhost:9090"]
    
      - job_name: "pushgateway"
        honor_labels: true
        static_configs:
          - targets: ["localhost:9091"]  # or "host.docker.internal:9091" if you are using Docker
     ```

3. Install Prometheus

    You can install Prometheus by following the instructions in the [official documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/).
    The easiest way to do that is via docker:
  
      ```bash
    docker volume create prometheus-data
    docker run -d \
        --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
        -p 9090:9090 \
        -v ./prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
        -v prometheus-data:/prometheus \
        prom/prometheus
      ```

4. Configure MyTonCtrl

    Enable mode `prometheus` in MyTonCtrl:

    ```bash
    MyTonCtrl> enable_mode prometheus
    ```

    Set the Pushgateway url:

    ```bash
    MyTonCtrl> set prometheus_url http://<host>:9091/metrics/job/<jobname>
    ```
    :::warning
    Note that it is very important to use different job names for different nodes in case you want to monitor multiple nodes with the same Prometheus instance.
    :::

5. Check the metrics

    You can check that Prometheus scrapes the metrics by opening the Prometheus web interface:

    ```bash
    http://<host>:9090/targets
    ```
