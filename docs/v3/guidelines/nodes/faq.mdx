## MyTonCtrl directory usage

MyTonCtrl is a wrapper that stores its files in two locations:

1. `~/.local/share/mytonctrl/`: Long-term files such as logs are stored here.
2. `/tmp/mytonctrl/`: Temporary files are stored here.

MyTonCtrl includes another script called `mytoncore`, which stores files in the following locations:

1. `~/.local/share/mytoncore/`: Permanent files, the main configuration will be stored here.
2. `/tmp/mytoncore/`: Temporary files and parameters used for elections will be saved here.

MyTonCtrl downloads its source code, along with the validator, into the following directories:

1. `/usr/src/mytonctrl/`
2. `/usr/src/ton/`

MyTonCtrl compiles the validator components into the following directory:

1. `/usr/bin/ton/`

MyTonCtrl creates a working directory for the validator here:

1. `/var/ton-work/`

---

## If MyTonCtrl was installed as root

When installed as root, some MyTonCtrl files (e.g., logs) are under:

1. `/usr/local/bin/mytonctrl/`
2. `/usr/local/bin/mytoncore/`

---

## How to remove MyTonCtrl

Run the script as an administrator and remove the compiled TON components:

```bash
sudo bash /usr/src/mytonctrl/scripts/uninstall.sh
```

Ensure you have the necessary permissions to delete or modify files and directories.

## Directory changes with MyTonCtrl

### Changing validator working directory pre-installation

If you want to change the working directory of the validator before installation, you have two options:

1. **Fork the project**: You can fork the project and make your modifications there. Refer to your Git hosting provider's documentation on forking a repository.

2. **Create a symbolic link**: Alternatively, you can create a symbolic link with the following command:

   ```bash
   ln -s /opt/ton /var/ton-work
   ```

This command will create a link at `/var/ton-work` that points to `/opt/ton`.

### Changing validator working directory post-installation

To change the working directory of the validator from `/var/ton-work/` after installation, follow these steps:

1. **Stop services**: First, stop the services using the following commands:

   ```bash
   systemctl stop validator.service
   systemctl stop mytoncore.service
   ```

2. **Move validator files**: Next, move the validator files with this command:

   ```bash
   rsync -a /var/ton-work/ /opt/ton-work/
   ```

3. **Update configuration paths**: After moving directories, update related paths and settings:
   - Systemd unit files (e.g., `validator.service`) to point to the new directory.
   - `~/.local/share/mytoncore/mytoncore.db` references.
   - `/var/ton-work/db/config.json` if it contains absolute paths.
   - Ownership and permissions of the moved files.

:::caution
Back up data and verify service configuration before proceeding with directory changes.
:::

Make sure you have sufficient permissions to execute these commands and make these changes.

## Understanding validator status and restarting validator in MyTonCtrl

This [guide](/v3/guidelines/nodes/running-nodes/validator-node) helps you confirm your node is acting as a validator.

## Restarting your validator

If you need to restart your validator, run this command:

```bash
systemctl restart validator.service
```

Please ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute these commands and make any needed adjustments.

:::caution
Remember to back up important data before performing operations that may affect your validator.
