# Custom overlays

TON nodes communicate with each other by forming subnets called **overlays**. Nodes participate in several common overlays, such as public overlays for each shard. Validators also participate in general validator overlays and overlays for specific validator sets.

Nodes can also be configured to join custom overlays for two primary purposes: broadcasting external messages and broadcasting block candidates.

Participation in custom overlays helps avoid uncertainties of public overlays and improves delivery reliability while reducing delays.

Each custom overlay has a strictly determined list of participants with predefined permissions, particularly permission to send external messages and block candidates. The overlay's configuration should be the same on all participating nodes.

If you have multiple nodes under your control, it is recommended to group them into a custom overlay, where all validators can send block candidates and all liteservers (LS) can send external messages. This helps LS synchronize faster while increasing the external message delivery rate and making delivery more robust. Note that an additional overlay causes additional network traffic.

## Default custom overlays

MyTonCtrl uses default custom overlays, which can be found [here](https://ton-blockchain.github.io/fallback_custom_overlays.json). These overlays are typically not in use and are meant for emergency situations when there are connectivity issues with the public overlay.

If you wish to stop participating in default custom overlays, please run the following commands:

```bash
MyTonCtrl> set useDefaultCustomOverlays false
MyTonCtrl> delete_custom_overlay default
```

## Creating a custom overlay

### Collect ADNL addresses

To add validators to a custom overlay, you can use either their `full node ADNL ID` available with `validator-engine-console` or `validator ADNL ID`, which can be found in MyTonCtrl's status.

To add liteservers to a custom overlay, you must use their `full node ADNL ID`.

### Create a config file

Create a config file in the following format:

```json
{
    "adnl_address_hex_1": {
        "msg_sender": true,
        "msg_sender_priority": 1
    },
    "adnl_address_hex_2": {
        "msg_sender": false
    },

    "adnl_address_hex_2": {
        "block_sender": true
    },
  ...
}
```

`msg_sender_priority` determines the order of external message inclusion in blocks: messages from higher-priority sources are processed first. Messages from the public overlay and local LS have priority 0.

:::caution
All nodes listed in the configuration **must** participate in the overlay; if they do not add an overlay with the exact same configuration, connectivity will be poor and broadcasts may fail.
:::

There is a special keyword `@validators` that MyTonCtrl generates automatically each round, adding all current validators.

### Add custom overlay

Use the following MyTonCtrl command to add a custom overlay:

```bash
MyTonCtrl> add_custom_overlay <name> <path_to_config>
```

:::caution
The name and configuration content **must** be the same on all overlay members. Check that the overlay has been created using MyTonCtrl's `list_custom_overlays` command.
:::

### Debug

Set the node verbosity level to 4 and grep the logs for `CustomOverlay`.

## Deleting a custom overlay

To remove a custom overlay from a node, use the MyTonCtrl command `delete_custom_overlay <name>`.

If the overlay is dynamic (i.e., there is a `@validators` word in the config), it will be deleted within one minute; otherwise, it will be removed instantly.

To make sure that the node has deleted the custom overlay, check MyTonCtrl's `list_custom_overlays` and the validator‑engine‑console `showcustomoverlays` command.

## Low‑level

List of validator-console commands for managing custom overlays:

- `addcustomoverlay <path_to_config>`: Adds a custom overlay to the local node. Note that this configuration must be in a format different from the config used for MyTonCtrl:

  ```json
  {
    "name": "OverlayName",
    "nodes": [
      {
        "adnl_id": "adnl_address_b64_1",
        "msg_sender": true,
        "msg_sender_priority": 1
      },
      {
        "adnl_id": "adnl_address_b64_2",
        "msg_sender": false
      }, ...
    ]
  }
  ```

- `delcustomoverlay <name>`: Removes the custom overlay from the node.

- `showcustomoverlays`: Displays a list of custom overlays known to the node.
