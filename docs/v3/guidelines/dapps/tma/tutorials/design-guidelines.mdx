# TMA design guidelines

:::info
Starting with Telegram app version **6.10**, Telegram updated the color palette for Mini Apps (TMA) by fixing some old colors and adding new ones.

:::

For context, let's look back at the update history.

## Changelog

- `bg_color` and `secondary_bg_color` have been updated.

## Reasons for these changes

- These colors were originally intended for page backgrounds, not UI controls.
- To maintain consistency, they have been updated.
- `section_bg_color` was introduced to color the backgrounds of different sections and cards.

To enhance your appâ€™s appearance, adjust how you use color variables.

The example above clearly shows what will change on iOS; for the `bg_color`/`secondary_bg_color` update, there should be no changes on Android.

1. New colors.
   Many new colors have been added, with most noticeable on Android; the examples focus on Android but apply to all platforms.

2. Telegram header colors have become available for Mini Apps.

3. `accent_text_color` is now available for highlighting accent elements in your apps. Previously, developers used the less suitable `link_color`.

4. For all secondary cell labels, use `subtitle_text_color` to create more contrast and improve accessibility.

5. A new token `section_header_text_color` is now available for section headers of cards.

6. For cells that trigger a destructive action, use `destructive_text_color` instead of a custom color.

7. Use `hint_color` for hint text under sections; on backgrounds like `secondary_bg_color`, use `link_color`.
