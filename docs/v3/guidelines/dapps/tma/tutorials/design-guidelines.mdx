# TMA design guidelines

:::info
Starting with Telegram app version **6.10**, Telegram updated the color palette for Mini Apps (TMA) by fixing some old colors and adding new ones.

:::

For context, let's look back at the update history.

## Changelog

- `bg_color` and `secondary_bg_color` have been updated.

## Reasons for these changes

- These colors were originally intended for page backgrounds, not UI controls.
- To maintain consistency, they have been updated.
- `section_bg_color` was introduced to color the backgrounds of different sections and cards.

To enhance your app’s appearance, adjust how you use color variables.

The example above clearly shows what will change on iOS; for the `bg_color`/`secondary_bg_color` update, there should be no changes on Android.

1. New colors.
   Many new colors have been added, with most noticeable on Android; the examples focus on Android but apply to all platforms.

2. Telegram header colors have become available for Mini Apps.

3. `accent_text_color` is now available for highlighting accent elements in your apps. Previously, developers used the less suitable `link_color`.

4. For all secondary cell labels, use `subtitle_text_color` to create more contrast and improve accessibility.

5. A new token `section_header_text_color` is now available for section headers of cards.

6. For cells that trigger a destructive action, use `destructive_text_color` instead of a custom color.

7. Use `hint_color` for hint text under sections; on backgrounds like `secondary_bg_color`, use `link_color`.
