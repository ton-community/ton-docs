### Are there recommended caching headers for HTML files?

:::tip
It’s best to disable caching in HTML files. To ensure caching is turned off, specify the following headers in the response:

```http
Cache-Control: no-store, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache
Expires: 0
```

### What is the suggested browser for TMA development?

Developing in Google Chrome is more convenient due to its familiar developer tools.

To retrieve the Mini App's initialization data, open the Mini App link in Chrome via Telegram Web (https://web.telegram.org/).

### Closing behavior

In many web applications, users may accidentally close the app while scrolling to the top. This can happen if they drag a section of the app too far, inadvertently triggering its closure.

To prevent accidental closures, enable closing confirmation in TMA with `window.Telegram.WebApp.enableClosingConfirmation()`. This method adds a confirmation dialog where the user can either approve or cancel closing the Mini App.

```typescript
window.Telegram.WebApp.enableClosingConfirmation()
```
