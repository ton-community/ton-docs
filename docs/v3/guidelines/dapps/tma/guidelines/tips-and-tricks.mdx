Developing in Google Chrome is more convenient due to its familiar developer tools.

To retrieve the mini-app's launch parameters and open this link in Chrome, use the web version of Telegram: [https://web.telegram.org/](https://web.telegram.org/)



### Closing behavior


In many web applications, users may accidentally close the app while scrolling to the top. This can happen if they drag a section of the app too far, inadvertently triggering its closure.

To prevent accidental closures, enable `closing_behavior` in TMA. This method adds a confirmation dialog, where the user can either approve or decline closing of the Web App.



```typescript
window.Telegram.WebApp.enableClosingConfirmation()
```
