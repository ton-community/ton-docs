## Overview

Telegram bots can fully replace traditional websites, offering seamless user authorization, Integrated payments with 20+ payment providers (including Google Pay & Apple Pay), tailored push notifications for engaging users, and much more.

With Mini Apps, bots gain an entirely new dimension. Developers can create highly flexible interfaces using JavaScript, the world's most widely used programming language.

Here are some key features of Telegram Mini Apps:

- **Integration within Telegram**: Telegram Mini Apps are designed to blend smoothly into Telegram, providing a native-like user experience. Users can access them from chats, groups, or inline bot interactions.
- **Enhanced Functionality**: TMAs go beyond messaging—they can power games, content-sharing apps, productivity tools, financial services, and more.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:  Since TMAs are web-based, they work seamlessly across Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, and Linux—no extra installations required.
- **Bot Interaction**: Many TMAs use Telegram bots for interactive, automated experiences, allowing users to receive real-time responses and dynamic content.
- **Development Frameworks**:  Developers can build TMAs with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging Telegram’s APIs to create feature-rich applications.
- **Monetization Opportunities**: TMAs can be monetized through in-app purchases, subscriptions, and ads, making them an attractive option for developers and businesses.
- **Web3 Ready**: TMAs support TON SDK, TON Connect, and token-based transactions, allowing seamless integration with blockchain-powered applications.
- **Community Development**: Telegram has a strong developer ecosystem, where third-party developers actively create and share TMAs, fostering innovation and diversity.

Telegram Mini Apps enhance the Telegram experience by bringing powerful new functionalities, while giving developers an opportunity to create, distribute, and monetize their apps within the Telegram ecosystem.
