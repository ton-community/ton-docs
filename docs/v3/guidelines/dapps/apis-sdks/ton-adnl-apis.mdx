# ADNL API

[ADNL]((/v3/documentation/network/protocols/adnl/overview)) is TON’s peer-to-peer protocol for direct communication with nodes. Unlike HTTP APIs, it gives developers verifiable, low-level access to blockchain data and transaction submission.

Clients connect directly to lite servers (nodes) using a binary protocol.

The client downloads keyblocks, which represent the current state of an account, and their Merkle proofs, ensuring the validity of the received data.

For read operations (such as get-method calls), the client launches a local TVM with a downloaded and verified state. There's no need to download the full blockchain state—the client only retrieves what’s required for the operation.

Read more about [Merkle proofs](/v3/documentation/dapps/proofs) in [TON whitepaper](https://ton.org/ton.pdf) sections 2.3.10 and 2.3.11.

## Pros & cons

- ✅ Reliable - Uses an API with Merkle proof hashes to verify incoming binary data.
- ✅ Secure - Since it checks Merkle proofs, you can even use untrusted lite servers.
- ✅ Fast - Connects directly to TON Blockchain nodes instead of relying on HTTP middleware.

- ❌ Complex - Requires time to set up and understand.
- ❌ Back-end first - Not compatible with web frontends (built for a non-HTTP protocol) unless you use an HTTP-ADNL proxy.

## API reference

Requests and responses follow the [TonLib schema](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/master/tl/generate/scheme/tonlib_api.tl), the formal specification of the API provided by TonLib (TON Library) written in [TL](/v3/documentation/data-formats/tl) (Type Language). It allows you to generate a typed interface for a specific programming language.
