# ADNL API

[ADNL](/v3/documentation/network/protocols/adnl/overview) is TON’s peer-to-peer protocol for direct communication with nodes. Unlike HTTP APIs, it gives developers verifiable, low-level access to blockchain data and transaction submission.

Clients connect directly to lite servers (nodes) using a binary protocol.

The client downloads key blocks, the current state of an account, and their Merkle proofs, ensuring the validity of received data.

For read operations (such as [get-method](/v3/guidelines/smart-contracts/get-methods) calls), the client launches a local TVM with a downloaded and verified state. There's no need to download the full blockchain state—the client only retrieves what’s required for the operation.

Read more about [Merkle proofs](/v3/documentation/dapps/proofs) in the TON Whitepaper (sections 2.3.10 and 2.3.11): https://docs.ton.org/ton.pdf

## Pros & cons

- ✅ Reliable - Uses Merkle proofs to verify incoming binary data.
- ✅ Secure - Since it checks Merkle proofs, you can even use untrusted liteservers.  
- ✅ Fast - Connects directly to TON Blockchain nodes instead of relying on HTTP middleware. 

- ❌ Complex - Requires time to set up and understand. 
- ❌ Backend-first - Not compatible with web frontends (built for a non-HTTP protocol) unless you use an HTTP↔ADNL proxy.

## API reference

Requests and responses follow the [TonLib schema](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/master/tl/generate/scheme/tonlib_api.tl), the formal specification of the API provided by TonLib (TON Library) written in [TL](/v3/documentation/data-formats/tl) (Type Language). It allows you to generate a typed interface for a specific programming language.

See available SDKs for ADNL in the [SDKs section](/v3/guidelines/dapps/apis-sdks/sdk#overview). For protocol details, refer to the [LiteServer TL schema](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/master/tl/generate/scheme/lite_api.tl).
