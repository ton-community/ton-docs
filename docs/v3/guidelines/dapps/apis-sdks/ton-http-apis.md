# TON HTTP-Based APIs

There are different ways to connect to the TON Blockchain:
1. **RPC data provider or another API** - You must rely on its stability and security.
2. ADNL connection - Connect to a [liteserver](/v3/guidelines/nodes/running-nodes/liteserver-node). While it may be inaccessible at times, it cannot provide false data due to library-implemented validation.
3. Tonlib binary - Also connects to a liteserver, so it shares the same advantages and limitations. However, your application includes a dynamically loaded library compiled externally.
4. Offchain-only - These SDKs allow you to create and serialize cells, which you can then send to APIs.

## Pros & Cons

- ✅ Easy-to-use - Ideal for newcomers exploring TON.
- ✅ Web-oriented - Suitable for loading data from TON smart contracts via the web and sending messages.

- ❌ Simplified - Does not provide indexed TON API data.
- ❌ HTTP-Middleware dependency - Server responses cannot be fully trusted unless augmented with [Merkle proofs](/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/proofs) to verify authenticity.

## Indexer

### Toncenter TON Index

Indexers allow you to list jetton wallets, NFTs, and transactions using filters, rather than retrieving only specific ones.

- Public TON Index can be used for free tests and development; [premium](https://t.me/tonapibot) plans are available for production at [toncenter.com/api/v3/](https://toncenter.com/api/v3/).
- Run your own TON Index with [Worker](https://github.com/toncenter/ton-index-worker/tree/36134e7376986c5517ee65e6a1ddd54b1c76cdba) and [TON Index API wrapper](https://github.com/toncenter/ton-indexer).

### Anton

Anton is an open-source TON blockchain indexer written in Go and licensed under Apache 2.0. It offers a scalable, flexible way for developers to access and analyze blockchain data. Developers can also add custom smart contracts with custom message schemas.

* [Project GitHub](https://github.com/tonindexer/anton) - Run your own indexer.
* [Swagger API documentation](https://github.com/tonindexer/anton), [API Query Examples](https://github.com/tonindexer/anton/blob/main/docs/API.md) - Learn how to use Anton.
* [Apache Superset](https://github.com/tonindexer/anton) - Visualize blockchain data.

### GraphQL Nodes

GraphQL nodes also function as indexers.

* [dton.io](https://dton.io/graphql) - Provides contract data with parsed "is jetton" and "is NFT" flags. It also allows transaction emulation and execution trace retrieval.

## Other APIs

* [TonAPI](https://docs.tonconsole.com/tonapi) - A user-friendly API that abstracts low-level smart contract details for a streamlined experience.
