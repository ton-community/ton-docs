# How to retrieve a TON Center API key

## Overview

When using the TON Center HTTP API, a token (API key) is generally not required. However, having a key may provide higher request rate limits. There are several available plans, all of which can be viewed in 
the [TON Center Mini App](https://t.me/tonapibot). Each subscription plan comes with specific rate limits, ranging from **10 requests/second** on the Free plan up to **100 requests/second** on Advanced, 
with higher or tailored limits available on Enterprise. Choosing a paid plan also unlocks more tokens per network and access to private liteservers.


## How to get a key
