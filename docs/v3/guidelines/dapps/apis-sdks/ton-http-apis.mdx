# TON HTTP-based APIs

There are several ways to connect to TON Blockchain:

1. **RPC data provider or another API** - You must rely on its stability and security.
2. **[ADNL connection](/v3/guidelines/dapps/apis-sdks/ton-adnl-apis)** - Connect to a [liteserver](/v3/guidelines/nodes/running-nodes/liteserver-node). While it may be inaccessible at times, it cannot provide false data due to library-implemented validation.
3. **Tonlib binary** - Also connects to a liteserver, so it shares the same advantages and limitations. However, your application includes a dynamically loaded library compiled externally.
4. **Off-chain only** - These SDKs allow you to create and serialize [cells](/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/cell-boc), which you can then send to APIs.

## Pros and cons

- ✅ Easy to use - Ideal for newcomers exploring TON.

- ✅ Web-oriented - Suitable for loading data from TON smart contracts via the web and sending messages.

- ❌ Simplified - Does not provide indexer-level, aggregated, or historical datasets; only raw RPC responses.
 
- ❌ HTTP middleware dependency - Server responses cannot be fully trusted unless augmented with [Merkle proofs](/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/proofs) to verify authenticity.

## Indexers

### TON Center index

Indexers let you query jetton wallets, NFTs, and transactions with filters, instead of fetching individual items one by one.

- The public TON Center index can be used for testing and development; [premium](https://t.me/tonapibot) plans are available for production at [toncenter.com/api/v3/](https://toncenter.com/api/v3/).
- Run your own TON index with [Worker](https://github.com/toncenter/ton-index-worker/tree/36134e7376986c5517ee65e6a1ddd54b1c76cdba) and the [TON indexer and API](https://github.com/toncenter/ton-indexer).

### Anton

Anton is an open-source TON Blockchain indexer written in Go and licensed under Apache 2.0. It offers a scalable, flexible way for developers to access and analyze blockchain data. Developers can also add custom smart contracts with custom message schemas.

- [Project GitHub](https://github.com/tonindexer/anton) - Run your own indexer.
- [Swagger API documentation](https://github.com/tonindexer/anton), [API query examples](https://github.com/tonindexer/anton/blob/main/docs/API.md) - Learn how to use Anton.
- [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/) - Visualize blockchain data.

### GraphQL node

This GraphQL node also functions as an indexer.

- [dton.io](https://dton.io/graphql) - Provides contract-type-aware data; also supports transaction emulation and execution trace retrieval.

## Other API

- [TonAPI](https://docs.tonconsole.com/tonapi) - A user-friendly API that abstracts low-level smart contract details for a streamlined experience.
