# API on TON

## Types of APIs

TON provides several ways to interact with the blockchain, depending on your use case:

- **RPC** — low-level access to TON nodes for queries and transactions.
- **Indexed API** — high-level access to structured blockchain data.
- **ADNL** — raw network-level protocol for advanced and custom integrations.

## RPC

Provides direct communication with TON nodes. Suitable for sending transactions and reading the blockchain state.

:::info
We recommend integrating at least 2 RPC providers for fault tolerance.

| Library      | Language   | Blockchain connection       | Description           |
|--------------|------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|
| [ton](https://github.com/ton-org/ton)   | JavaScript | RPC through [Orbs](https://www.orbs.com/ton-access/), [TON Center](https://toncenter.com/api/v2/)         | Client library providing wallet wrappers for building DApps on TON Blockchain. |


## Indexed API

APIs that provide structured, historical, and aggregated blockchain data. Useful for explorers, analytics, and applications that need fast queries without running a node.

### Providers

- [TON API](https://docs.tonconsole.com/tonapi)
- [TON Center v3](https://toncenter.com/api/v3/index.html)


## ADNL

ADNL (Abstract Datagram Network Layer) is TON’s peer-to-peer protocol. It allows low-level network messaging and direct interaction with nodes. Typically used for building node software, validators, or advanced network tools.

Learn more in the [ADNL overview](/v3/documentation/network/protocols/adnl/overview).
