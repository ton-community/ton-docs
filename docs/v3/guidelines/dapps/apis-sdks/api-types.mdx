# APIs

## Types of API

TON provides several ways to interact with the blockchain, depending on your use case:

- **HTTP API** — basic access to blockchain data for queries and transactions.
- **Indexed API** — high-level access to structured blockchain data.
- **ADNL** — raw network-level protocol for advanced and custom integrations.

## HTTP API
The HTTP API allows you to interact with the TON blockchain through both REST and JSON-RPC interfaces: fetch account and wallet information, explore blocks and transactions, send messages, call smart contract methods, and more.

We recommend integrating at least 2 providers for production environment.

### Own instance

See the [API setup guide](https://github.com/toncenter/ton-http-api) for instructions on running your own instance.

### SDKs


| Library                                    | Language   | Description           |

| [@ton/ton](https://github.com/ton-org/ton) | JavaScript | Client library providing wallet wrappers for building DApps on TON Blockchain. |


## Indexed API

APIs that provide structured, historical, and aggregated blockchain data. Useful for explorers, analytics, and applications that need fast queries without running a node.

### Providers

- [TON API](https://docs.tonconsole.com/tonapi)
- [TON Center v3](https://toncenter.com/api/v3/index.html)


## ADNL

ADNL (Abstract Datagram Network Layer) is TON’s peer-to-peer protocol. It allows low-level network messaging and direct interaction with nodes. Typically used for building node software, validators, or advanced network tools.

Learn more in the [ADNL overview](/v3/documentation/network/protocols/adnl/overview).

:::info
We recommend running your own lite servers or using trusted providers for production environment.
:::

### Providers

- [dTON](https://t.me/dtontech_bot)
- Public lite servers from the [global config](/v3/documentation/network/configs/network-configs).

### Own instance

See the [lite server setup guide](/v3/guidelines/nodes/running-nodes/liteserver-node) for instructions on running your own instance.

### Usage

See a dedicated page about [ADNL API](/v3/guidelines/dapps/apis-sdks/ton-adnl-apis).
