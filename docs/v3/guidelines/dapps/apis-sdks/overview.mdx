# Overview

This page helps you choose the right tools to integrate TON Blockchain into your dApp.

## Interaction with TON Blockchain

To interact with TON Blockchain and process its data, choose one of the listed [APIs](/v3/guidelines/dapps/apis-sdks/api-types) and a suitable [SDK](/v3/guidelines/dapps/apis-sdks/sdk).

## Analytics data

Developers often need to run analytical queries on top of on-chain dataâ€”for example, to track historical changes and aggregate data from multiple accounts.
Since blockchains are not designed for analytical workloads, you need to build an indexing pipeline and run off-chain analytical queries. Creating such pipelines
from scratch can be resource-consuming, so you can use one of these alternatives:

- [Dune analytics](https://dune.com/queries?category=canonical&namespace=ton) provides tables with TON data, including raw transactions and messages, jetton events, and DEX trades. Dune allows building custom charts and dashboards, fetch query results via API and set up alerts. Before writing queries, check [this guide](https://dune.com/ton_foundation/ton-quick-start) for best practices, tips, and tricks.
- Dune integration is runs on the public data lake from the [ton-etl](https://github.com/re-doubt/ton-etl/blob/main/datalake/README.md) project. This parsing and decoding pipeline dumps raw and decoded data into an S3 bucket **s3://ton-blockchain-public-datalake/v1/** in AVRO format. The bucket is publicly available and everyone can use it with [Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/) (see [DDLs](https://github.com/re-doubt/ton-etl/blob/main/datalake/athena_ddl.sql)) or Apache Spark. The data updates daily.
- If you need real-time on-chain data tracking, you can run your own [TON node](/v3/documentation/infra/nodes/node-types) and launch [ton-etl](https://github.com/re-doubt/ton-etl/blob/main/README.md) or [ton-index-worker](https://github.com/toncenter/ton-index-worker).
- [Chainbase](https://docs.chainbase.com/catalog/Ton/Overview) offers a set of raw and decoded tables with TON data. It allows you to run SQL queries and fetch results via API.
