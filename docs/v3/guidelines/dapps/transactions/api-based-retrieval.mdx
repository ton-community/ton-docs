# API-based retrieval

This section covers how to access transaction data from the blockchain using APIs. You'll learn about the available API services in TON and how to retrieve data by account, by message, or through a full blockchain scan.

## APIs of TON 

An _HTTP API service_ is a software solution that retrieves raw data from a LiteServer node and encodes it into standard formats for other services.
A provider that offers such a solution is referred to as an HTTP API _provider_.

In this section, we review services that are part of the native infrastructure. Most third-party API providers rely on one of these standard solutions.
We recommend evaluating each provider independently based on its [historical performance](https://tonstat.us/) and suitability for your specific use case.

### TON Center

TON Center offers two levels of API access:

- **TON Center API/v3:** delivers indexed and enriched blockchain data in a convenient format, with support for flexible filtering. Data is validated once at indexing time.
- **TON Center API/v2:** provides data directly from TON nodes. It supports limited filtering and validates data on every request.

### TON API

A solution focused on business needs. It often provides ready-made implementations for common tasks in TON.

## API data levels

HTTP services retrieve data from LiteServer nodes and deserialize it according to the TL-B schema.
Data that undergoes minimal post-processing is often referred to as **raw data**. This format is typically used in solutions where architectural priorities favor security and precision over ease of integration or simplicity. These solutions offload the interpretation and analysis of raw data to the client side, allowing for greater control and reliability at the cost of additional local resource consumption.

In contrast, when working with event analytics that does **not** involve significant asset transfers, it is often more efficient to use **high-level interfaces** — such as APIs that apply post-processing before returning results. These interfaces provide simplified, structured data that is easier to work with in most application-level scenarios.

In TON, transactions are grouped into blocks. Because TON uses **sharding**, each MasterChain block includes references to the corresponding shard blocks. A shard block in the BaseChain is considered finalized once a MasterChain block references that block. This also applies if any block built on top of it (its descendants) is referenced. To retrieve all transactions, services must, therefore, read both the MasterChain and the relevant BaseChain shard blocks.

All WorkChain blocks follow a consistent structure. For transaction analysis, the relevant section is the `block_extra` field.

```tlb
block#11ef55aa global_id:int32
info:^BlockInfo value_flow:^ValueFlow
state_update:^(MERKLE_UPDATE ShardState)
extra:^BlockExtra = Block;
```

The `block_extra` section of a block contains the `account_blocks` structure,
which in turn includes the transactions processed by all accounts within the corresponding shard.

```tlb
block_extra in_msg_descr:^InMsgDescr
out_msg_descr:^OutMsgDescr
account_blocks:^ShardAccountBlocks
rand_seed:bits256
created_by:bits256
custom:(Maybe ^McBlockExtra) = BlockExtra;
```

Thus, when reading the blockchain, services iteratively process blocks, starting from the most recently processed block and proceeding up to the latest finalized block. The extracted transactions are considered **raw data** and can be passed to downstream services for further use. Additionally, specialized services may analyze and enrich this data to strike a balance between the complexity and the trustless nature of the system.

## API approaches for transaction access

### Key terms

- **Transaction**: a transaction represents a state change of an account in the blockchain. It is triggered by an incoming message and may optionally result in one or more outgoing messages. Analyzing the contents of a transaction is a fundamental method used across all services.

- **Trace**: a trace is a deterministic graph of all transactions triggered by a single external message. Trace interfaces enable the retrieval of the complete graph associated with a specific transaction, making it easier to analyze all related interactions.
  This is especially useful for exchanges and analytical tools to verify asset flows or to reconstruct the logic of a business operation.
  Traces can also be used to detect Jetton transfers even in the absence of Jetton notification messages. It is particularly relevant when a business operation spans multiple interdependent transactions.

- **Action**: an action is an aggregated abstraction that represents a complete business operation across one or more account state changes.
  For example, transferring Jettons between two users would be represented as a single action.
  Actions are used exclusively for visualization and have no role in the actual execution or validation of fund transfers.

---

### High-level access

**How to fetch a list of transactions or a single transaction via API**

To fetch transaction data, you can use high-level interfaces such as:

- `GET /actions`
- `GET /traces`
- `GET /jetton/transfers` and `GET /jetton/burns`
- `GET /nft`

With this approach, the developer doesn’t need to parse the contents of individual transactions.
This method, which involves no additional data validation, is only suitable when fund transfers are not involved.
In addition to simple service-level checks, this approach can also be used in more advanced scenarios. For example, by using the **traces** method, you can identify all related transactions for further analysis.

---

### By message payload

To get transactions by external or internal message, use [/api/v3/transactionsByMessage](https://toncenter.com/api/v3/index.html#/blockchain/api_v3_get_transactions_by_message).
Available only in API/v3.

This approach is beneficial when tracking a small number of accounts (up to \~10).
It works well for wallet-v4 and wallet-v5 transfers and is primarily used to find transactions triggered by external messages.

:::note
There may be a delay of up to 10 seconds due to the time required to finalize the block.
For better performance in real-time scenarios, consider also monitoring the pending pool.

### By account address

To query transactions for an account you are monitoring, use either [/api/v2/getTransactions](https://toncenter.com/api/v2/#/accounts/get_transactions_getTransactions_get) or [/api/v3/transactions](https://toncenter.com/api/v3/index.html#/blockchain/api_v3_get_transactions) with `account` filter.
This method is broadly supported, including LiteClient. It's suitable for tracking up to \~100 accounts.

---

### Full blockchain transaction scan

When monitoring a large number of accounts (1,000 or more), it's better to iterate through all transactions starting from the latest MasterChain block.

- **API/v2**:

1. Fetch shard information for the MasterChain block
2. Compute shard diffs
3. For each resulting block, call `getBlockTransactionsExt`
   See: TON Center cookbook: [How to scan the blockchain](https://docs.toncenter.com/docs/ton-center-cookbook#how-to-scan-blockchain)

- **API/v3**:

Do not reuse the API/v2 logic. Instead, use the dedicated method:

[GET /api/v3/transactionsByMasterchainBlock](https://toncenter.com/api/v3/index.html#/blockchain/api_v3_get_transactions_by_masterchain_block)

You have a choice: either a straightforward implementation that places a high level of trust in major providers or a more complex one that does not require trusting the provider.
However, for greater security, it is always recommended to process transactions block by block independently.

---

### API response

In the blockchain, a regular transaction consists of a body and a header.


```tlb
transaction$0111 account_addr:bits256 lt:uint64
    prev_trans_hash:bits256 prev_trans_lt:uint64 now:uint32
    outmsg_cnt:uint15
    orig_status:AccountStatus end_status:AccountStatus
    ^[ in_msg:(Maybe ^(Message Any)) out_msgs:(HashmapE 15 ^(Message Any)) ]
    total_fees:CurrencyCollection state_update:^(HASH_UPDATE Account)
    description:^TransactionDescr = Transaction;
```

The header `TransactionDescr` defines the nature of the transaction in the blockchain. All user-initiated service operations are represented as regular transactions of type **Ordinary**.

```tlb
trans_ord$0000 credit_first:Bool
  storage_ph:(Maybe TrStoragePhase)
  credit_ph:(Maybe TrCreditPhase)
  compute_ph:TrComputePhase action:(Maybe ^TrActionPhase)
  aborted:Bool bounce:(Maybe TrBouncePhase)
  destroyed:Bool
  = TransactionDescr;
```

Each transaction returned in the API response (`Transaction[]`) reflects the structure defined in TL-B but often includes additional computed fields for convenience.

- Native – present on-chain. This refers to the field name as defined in the TL-B `block.tlb` schemas.
- Native computed – the core data exists on-chain, but additional information is expanded by the API.
- Postprocessed – data computed additionally by the API provider based on indexed information.

One of the **most important computed fields** is the **transaction hash**. The transaction hash is not stored on‑chain as a field; it is a deterministic representation hash of the Transaction cell that APIs compute and clients can compute locally.

```json
"hash": "/QesPZ+FW7Z0MdG/vVDuYR/sK1dWx2Nip6CCDbdqQeM="
```

## TON Center

### Transaction API/v2

The [https://toncenter.com/api/v2/getTransactions](https://toncenter.com/api/v2/getTransactions) method returns raw transaction data based on the TL-B structure.

Example `curl` request:

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://toncenter.com/api/v2/getTransactions?address=EQAFmjUoZUqKFEBGYFEMbv-m61sFStgAfUR8J6hJDwUU09iT&limit=10&to_lt=0&archival=true' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

The response includes the transaction body, which consists of the following components:

- `@fields` - internal maintenance fields in TON Center API/v2.
- Header data - transaction metadata `lt`, `now` (Unix time)
- Fees - high-level information
- Incoming message data — an internal or external incoming message that initiated the transaction
- Outgoing message data — the array that optionally contains from 0 to 255 messages sent during this transaction

### Transaction API/v3

The API service deserializes the entire transaction structure with precise mapping to appropriate string and numeric types.
As a result, the transaction body is returned in JSON format.

The [https://toncenter.com/api/v3/transactions](https://toncenter.com/api/v3/transactions) method returns a large structure enriched with additional computed data.

Example request:

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://toncenter.com/api/v3/transactions?limit=10&offset=0&sort=desc' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

The transaction object includes the following key sections:

- Header data - transaction metadata `lt`, `now` (Unix time)
- Incoming message data - a message that initiated the transaction
- Compute phase data - results of command executions
- Action phase data — results of actions performed after the compute phase.
- Block reference — reference to the block this transaction belongs to.
- Account state before and after
