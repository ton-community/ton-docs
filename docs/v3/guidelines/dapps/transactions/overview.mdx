# Mastering transactions

In TON, a transaction is not something you send or receive — it’s not a user action. It’s a **record** of all changes that occurred to an account.

This guide helps you master TON transactions — from the core principles of what they are and how they work to defining what it means for a transaction to be successful. Use the sections below to explore the topic you need — whether you're starting from foundations or debugging real transaction data.
