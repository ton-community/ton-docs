# Mass minting tools

As major on-chain projects reach millions of users, peak loads can impact the user experience across the entire TON ecosystem.

To prevent these issues and ensure a smooth launch, we recommend using the high-load distribution tools listed on this page.

### Mass sender

:::info
Recommended for token airdrops. Battle-tested on Notcoin and DOGS.
:::

Access: [Mass sender](https://docs.tonconsole.com/tonconsole/jettons/mass-sending)

Specification:
- Directly distributes tokens, with the project covering gas fees.
- Low network load (latest versions are optimized).
- Self-regulates load by slowing distribution when network activity is high.

### Mintless jettons

Access: [Mintless jettons](/v3/guidelines/dapps/asset-processing/mintless-jettons)

Specification:
- Users receive airdrop jettons without a separate claim transaction.
- Minimal network load.


### TokenTable

:::info
Battle-tested on Avacoin and DOGS.
:::

Access: [TokenTable](https://docs.tokentable.xyz/)

Specification:
- Higher network load than mass sender, as users make transactions when claiming.
- Projects can also earn from user claims.
- Projects pay TokenTable for setup.


### Gigadrop

:::info
Battle-tested on HAMSTER.
:::

Access: [Gigadrop](https://gigadrop.io/)

Specification:
