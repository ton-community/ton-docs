# Mass minting tools

In an era of launching major on-chain projects with millions of users, peak loads can impact the user experience across entire TON Ecosystem.

To prevent these issues and ensure a smooth launch, we recommend using the high-load distribution system provided on this page.

- Directly distributes tokens, with the project covering gas fees.
- Low network load (latest versions are optimized).
