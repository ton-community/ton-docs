# Mass minting tools

As major on-chain projects reach millions of users, peak loads can impact the user experience across the entire TON ecosystem.

To prevent these issues and ensure a smooth launch, we recommend using the high-load distribution tools listed on this page.

### Mass sender

Recommended for token airdrops. Battle-tested on Notcoin and DOGS in September.

Access: [Mass sender](https://docs.tonconsole.com/tonconsole/jettons/mass-sending)

Specification:
- Directly distributes tokens, with the project covering gas fees during claims.
- Low network load (latest versions are optimized).
- Self-regulates load by slowing distribution when network activity is high.
