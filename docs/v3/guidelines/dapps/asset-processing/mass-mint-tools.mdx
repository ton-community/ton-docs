# Mass Minting Tools

In an era of launching major on-chain projects with millions of users, peak loads can lead to issues in user experience across the entire TON Ecosystem.

To prevent this situation and ensure a smooth launch, we suggest using a provided on this page high-load distribution system.

### Mass Sender
