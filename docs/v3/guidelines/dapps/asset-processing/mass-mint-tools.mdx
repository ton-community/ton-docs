# Mass Minting Tools

In an era of launching major on-chain projects with millions of users, peak loads can lead to issues in user experience across the entire TON Ecosystem.

To prevent this situation and ensure a smooth launch, we suggest using a provided on this page high-load distribution system.

## Mass Sender

:::info
Recommended approach for token airdrops in September
battle-tested on Notcoin, DOGS
:::

Access: [Masse Sender](https://docs.tonconsole.com/tonconsole/jettons/mass-sending)

Specification:
- Direct distribution of tokens, the project spends money on gas during claims
- Low network load (latest versions are optimized)
- Self-regulation of load (slows down distribution if there's too much activity on the network)

## Mintless Jettons

Access: [Mintless Jettons](/v3/guidelines/dapps/asset-processing/mintless-jettons)

:::caution
  Currently being tested on HAMSTER
  Work In Progress
:::

Specification:
- Users claim airdrop tokens without transactions
- Projects don't earn from claims
- Minimal network load


### TokenTable v4

:::info
  battle-tested on Avacoin, DOGS
:::

Access: [www.tokentable.xyz](https://www.tokentable.xyz/)

- Higher network load than mass sender, users make transactions when claiming
- Projects can also earn from user claims
- Projects pay TokenTable for setup
