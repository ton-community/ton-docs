### Example of Organizing an Airdrop

1. Collect a list of eligible user wallet addresses within your DApp;
2. Enter the airdrop details in TONAPI Airdrop: token address, claim fee;
3. Upload the wallet list;
4. Enable claims.

On the client side of the DApp, implement a request to our API (details in the [documentation](https://docs.tonconsole.com/tonconsole/jettons/airdrop#api-for-dapp-interaction)). If a positive response is received, the user will be prompted to claim the token.
