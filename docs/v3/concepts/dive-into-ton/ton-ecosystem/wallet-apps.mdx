## Non-custodial software wallets (hot)

Non-custodial wallets provide users with complete control over their assets. The private keys are stored exclusively by the wallet owner, and access is secured through a seed phrase—a unique set of 12 or 24 words.

## Non-custodial hardware wallets (cold)

Non-custodial wallets provide users with complete control over their assets. The private keys are stored exclusively by the wallet owner, and access is secured through a seed phrase—a unique set of 12 or 24 words.

A hardware wallet is a physical device that stores the private keys to your cryptocurrency funds away from the internet. Even if you make transactions with it, the wallet confirms the transactions in an offline environment. This process helps keep your private keys away from the risks of the internet at all times.



### Ledger

[Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) is a hardware wallet with a Ledger Live app.
