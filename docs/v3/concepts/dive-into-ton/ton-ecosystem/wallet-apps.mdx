## Non-custodial wallets

**Non-custodial wallets** empower users with full ownership and control over their private keys and funds. Unlike custodial wallets, which a third party manages, non-custodial wallets store private keys exclusively with the user, secured using a seed phrase — a unique sequence of 24 words.

### Software (hot) wallets

A **software wallet** — commonly referred to as a **hot wallet** — runs locally on a device such as a smartphone or computer, storing private keys securely within the device’s storage.

Below is a selection of prominent non-custodial software wallets.

### Hardware (cold) wallets

**Hardware wallets** are physical devices that store private keys offline, isolating them from internet risks. Even when authorizing transactions, these devices sign them in a secure, offline environment, ensuring private keys never leave the device.

## Custodial wallets

In **custodial wallets**, a third party — such as a cryptocurrency exchange — holds and manages users’ private keys. This means users entrust the entity with the storage and control of their assets.
