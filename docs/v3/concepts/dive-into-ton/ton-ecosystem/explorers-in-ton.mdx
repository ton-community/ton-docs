# Explorers in TON

In this article, we will consider TON explorers, their capabilities and features from the point of view of the developer.

## What is an explorer?

An explorer is a website that allows you to view information in a blockchain, such as the account balance, transaction history, blocks, etc.

## Which explorers exist?

Among TON explorers, you can distinguish several categories:

- For everyday use
- With extended information for developers
- Specialized

This division into categories is largely conditional and one explorer can belong to several categories at the same time. So let's not pay too much attention to this.


## Address Alias in Explorers

Make your service address more user-friendly by using an address alias. Create Pull Requests (PRs) according to the provided guidelines:

- [tonkeeper/ton-assets](https://github.com/tonkeeper/ton-assets) - Tonviewer.com alias
- [catchain/address-book](https://github.com/catchain/address-book)- Tonscan.org alias

## General functionality

Let's start with the general functionality that is present in all explorers.

Almost all explorers have the ability to find out information about balances, transaction history and information about the smart contract, if deployed on the address.

Next, we will consider several explorers that can be attributed to each of these categories.

## TON Scan.org

Good explorer for everyday use. It provides a comprehensive view of the TON Blockchain, allowing users to search for transactions, addresses, blocks, and more. Any search is performed against the public [address book](https://github.com/catchain/tonscan/blob/master/src/addrbook.json) (TON Foundation, OKX and etc.)
