# Blockchain services

## Domain name systems

On Ethereum, users use the **Ethereum Name Service (ENS)**, a decentralized naming system built on top of the Ethereum blockchain.

The TON blockchain includes an embedded domain name system called the [TON DNS](/v3/guidelines/web3/ton-dns/dns). This service allows users to register human-readable domain names for smart contracts, websites, or other online content. This service facilitates interaction with **decentralized applications (DApps)** and other resources on the TON blockchain.

TON DNS functions similarly to traditional Internet DNS systems, but its decentralized nature eliminates the need for a centralized authority to control and manage domain names, thereby reducing the risks of censorship, fraud, and domain name hijacking.

One key feature of TON DNS is the ability to bind crypto wallets to domain names directly. Users can send cryptocurrency to names like `alice.place.ton`, which resolve to wallet addresses, simplifying donations and payments.

## TON Proxy

[TON Proxy](/v3/guidelines/web3/ton-proxy-sites/connect-with-ton-proxy) is a tool based on the TON protocol that offers high security. All data transmitted through TON Proxy is encrypted, thus protecting users' confidential information.

## Decentralized storage

Ethereum is not suitable for storing large amounts of data. Therefore, decentralized storage on Ethereum typically involves using distributed file systems to store and retrieve data in a decentralized and secure manner. One popular approach to decentralized storage on Ethereum is the **InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)**, a peer-to-peer file system that allows users to store and retrieve files from a distributed network.

The TON network has its own decentralized storage service called [TON Storage](/v3/guidelines/web3/ton-storage/storage-daemon), which the TON blockchain uses to store archive copies of blocks and state data. TON Storage can also store users’ and services’ files with torrent-like access technology. A popular use case is storing NFT metadata directly on TON Storage, without using additional distributed file storage services like IPFS. TON Storage also distributes blockchain snapshots.

## Payment services

[TON Payments](/v3/documentation/dapps/defi/ton-payments) is a solution for lightning-fast transactions on the TON blockchain. While the TON blockchain is sufficient for most tasks, some applications, such as [TON Proxy](/v3/guidelines/web3/ton-proxy-sites/connect-with-ton-proxy), [TON Storage](/v3/guidelines/web3/ton-storage/storage-daemon), or a particular DApp, require microtransactions with much higher speed and lower costs. In TON, payment channels solve this problem.

Payment channels allow two parties to make transactions off-chain by creating a special smart contract on the blockchain with their initial balances. They can then perform as many transactions between them as they want without per-transaction network fees. The network charges fees only when opening and closing the channel. The technology guarantees proper operation by allowing a party to close the channel if the other party cheats or disappears.
