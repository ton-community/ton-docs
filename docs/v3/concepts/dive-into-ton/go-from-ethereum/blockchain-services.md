# Blockchain services

## Domain name systems

In Ethereum, users use the **Ethereum Name Service (ENS)**, a decentralized naming system built on top of the Ethereum blockchain.

The TON blockchain includes an embedded domain name system called the TON DNS. This service allows users to register human-readable domain names for smart contracts, websites, or other online content. Such a device facilitates interaction with **decentralized applications (DApps)** and other resources on the TON blockchain. 

The DNS system in TON functions similarly to traditional Internet DNS systems, but its decentralized nature eliminates the need for a centralized authority to control and manage domain names, thereby reducing the risks of censorship, fraud, and domain name hijacking.

One key feature of TON DNS is the ability to bind crypto wallets to domain names directly. This feature allows users to send cryptocurrency to addresses like `alice.place.ton` without additional details. This feature simplifies the process of donations and payments, making it more intuitive and convenient.

## Proxy

TON Proxy is a tool based on the TON protocol that offers high security and anonymity. All data transmitted through TON Proxy is encrypted, thus protecting users' confidential information.

One of TON Proxy's key advantages is bypassing blockades imposed by ISPs or government agencies. This property makes it an essential tool for users who need free access to information on the Internet without restrictions.

In addition, TON Proxy helps to speed up Internet connection speeds. It automatically selects the servers with the lowest load, improving the quality of connection and Internet access speed. 

## Decentralized storage

Ethereum is not suitable for storing large amounts of data. Therefore, decentralized storage on Ethereum typically involves using distributed file systems to store and retrieve data in a decentralized and secure manner. One popular approach to decentralized storage on Ethereum is the **InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)**, a peer-to-peer file system that allows users to store and retrieve files from a distributed network.

The TON network has its own decentralized storage service called snapshots, which the TON blockchain uses to store archive copies of blocks and status data. The service can also store usersâ€™ files or other services running on the platform with torrent-like access technology. The most popular use case is to store NFT metadata directly on TON storage, not using additional distributed file storage services like IPFS.

## Payment services

TON Payments is a solution for lightning-fast transactions with zero network fees on the TON blockchain. While the TON blockchain is sufficient for most tasks, some applications, such as TON Proxy, TON Storage, or a particular decentralized application, require micro-transactions with much higher speed and lower costs. In TON, Payment channels solve this problem. 

Payment channels allow two parties to make transactions off-chain by creating a special smart contract on the blockchain with their initial balances. They can then perform as many transactions between them as they want without any speed limits or fees. The network charges fees only when opening and closing the channel. The technology guarantees proper operation by allowing a party to close the channel if the other party cheats or disappears.
