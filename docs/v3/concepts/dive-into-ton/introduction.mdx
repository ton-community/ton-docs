# The Open Network


**The Open Network (TON)** is a decentralized and open internet platform comprising several components. These include TON Blockchain, TON DNS, TON Storage, TON Sites, and TON Proxy. TON Blockchain is the core protocol connecting TON’s underlying infrastructure to form the greater TON Ecosystem.

TON focuses on achieving widespread cross-chain interoperability while operating within a highly scalable and secure framework. It aims to process millions of transactions per second and eventually reach hundreds of millions of users.

__TON Blockchain__, designed as a distributed supercomputer, serves as the heart of TON. It aims to provide various products and services that contribute to developing the decentralized vision for the new internet.

To understand the true vision for the decentralized internet and how TON contributes to this inevitability, consider taking a deep dive into the video below:
