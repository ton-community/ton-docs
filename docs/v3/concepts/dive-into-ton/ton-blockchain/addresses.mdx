# Addresses

Every [account](/v3/concepts/dive-into-ton/ton-blockchain/accounts), including wallets and smart contracts, is represented by an address, used for all on-chain interactions.

## Components

A TON address is a composite identifier consisting of two main components:

- **WorkChain ID**: identifies a specific WorkChain (for example, MasterChain is `-1`, and BaseChain is `0`).<br/>
- **Account ID**: a unique identifier for a contract within its WorkChain.
It is derived from the hash of the contract’s initial state, which includes the code and data.

For detailed technical specifications, see the [Addresses documentation](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/addresses/address).

## Status

Every address on the TON Blockchain exists in one of four statuses, reflecting its lifecycle and operational condition.

Three of them are derived from its [account state](/v3/concepts/dive-into-ton/ton-blockchain/accounts#state):
- `uninit`
- `active`
- `frozen`

The fourth is `nonexist`, a special status used when the account does not exist at all.

The status defines the account’s capabilities and is fundamental to transaction processing. Further details are available in the [address states documentation](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/addresses/address-states).

## Formats

TON addresses are represented in two formats:

-   **Raw format**: a direct representation of WorkChain ID and Account ID (e.g., `-1:fcb...260`). Intended for system-level use.
-   **User-friendly format**: a base64-encoded version of the raw address that includes flags and a checksum. Designed for user interfaces, this format enhances security and prevents errors.

These formats are not interchangeable. The user-friendly format includes critical metadata, such as the _bounceable flag_, which determines message-handling behavior for uninitialized accounts.

A bounceable message sent to an address in `nonexist`, `uninit` or `frozen` status is returned to the sender. In contrast, a non-bounceable message will be credited to the account.

For a detailed breakdown of address structures, encoding, and flags, refer to the [address formats documentation](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/addresses/address-formats).
