# TON Virtual Machine (TVM)

**TON Virtual Machine (TVM)** is the environment where smart contracts are executed.
It works like a tiny computer inside the blockchain, designed for efficiency and security.

- TVM reads the contract’s **code** (stored as [cells](/v3/concepts/dive-into-ton/ton-blockchain/cells)).
- It processes **messages** sent to the contract.
- It updates the contract’s **data** according to the code logic.
- It may generate **outgoing messages** to other contracts.

Learn more in the [TVM overview section](/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-overview).

### Key features

- **Deterministic execution**: given the same inputs, TVM always produces the same outputs.
- **Stack-based design**: computations are performed on a stack of values.
- **Gas system**: each operation costs gas, preventing infinite loops.
- **Continuation cells**: special cells used by TVM to store executable code.


## Why it matters

Smart contracts and TVM together make TON a **programmable blockchain** — not just a ledger, but a platform where apps and services can run.
