# Cells as data storage

In TON, a **cell** is a built material for the entire blockchain. The cell is a data structure containing:

- up to **1023 bits**  of data
- up to **4 references** to other cells
- cell stores bits and references separated.
- cell forbids circular references: for any cell, none of its descendant cells can reference this original cell.

Thus, all cells constitute a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Here's a good picture to illustrate:

    }}

## Cell types
Currently, there are five types of cells: one ordinary cell and four exotic cells.
The exotic types are the following:
* Pruned branch cell
* Library reference cell
* Merkle proof cell
* Merkle update cell

## Cell flavors

A cell is an opaque object optimized for compact storage.

It deduplicates data: it only stores the content of several equivalent sub-cells referenced in different branches once. However, one cannot modify or read a cell directly because of its opaqueness. Thus, there are two additional flavors of the cells:
* **Builder** is a flavor for constructing cells
* **Slice** for a flavor for reading cells 

Another unique cell flavor in TVM:

* **Continuation**  for cells containing opcodes instructions for TON Virtual Machine, see [TVM bird's-eye overview](/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-overview).

## Serialization of data to cells

Any object in TON, like the message, block, or whole blockchain state, serializes to a cell.

A TL-B scheme describes the serialization process: a formal description of how this object can be serialized into _builder_ or how to parse an object of a given type from the _Slice_.
TL-B for cells is the same as TL or ProtoBuf for byte-streams.

If you want more details about cell serialization and deserialization, read [Cell & Bag of Cells](/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/cell-boc) article.
