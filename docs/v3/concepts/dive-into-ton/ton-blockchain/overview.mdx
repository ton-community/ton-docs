# Overview

A **blockchain** is a chain of blocks, each containing information that all participants in the network can access and trust. Every block is securely linked to the previous one, and the entire chain is continuously replicated and synchronized across the network.

The following key properties characterize a blockchain:

- **Immutable** – once data is added, it cannot be modified or removed.
- **Decentralized** – no single authority governs the chain; it is maintained collectively by network participants.
- **Transparent** – all data is openly accessible, enabling anyone to verify the integrity and history of the chain.

## TON Blockchain

Building on these principles, TON Blockchain introduces its own _architecture design_.

Unlike traditional _single-chain systems_, TON uses a **multi-chain**, **sharded architecture** - think of it as a _well-structured city_.
- At the center is the **MasterChain**, like a city hall. It maintains the official records, including the city map, the list of districts, and the registry of those responsible for keeping everything running smoothly.
- Below it are **WorkChains**—the districts of the city, each with its own purpose and set of rules. One of these is the **BaseChain**, the central and busiest district, where most everyday activities take place.
- Each WorkChain is divided into **ShardChains**, which are like streets within a district, allowing activity to happen in parallel without traffic jams.
- And at the smallest level are **AccountChains**, the individual buildings where accounts reside, keeping track of their own local history of **transactions**, including every action or change that happens to that account.

All these levels work together: activity starts in the buildings **(accounts)**, flows through the streets **(shards)**, gets organized within districts **(WorkChains)**, and stays coordinated by the city hall **(the MasterChain)**.
