# Smart contracts

In TON, every account can be more than just a balance holder — it can also contain **code** and **data**.
When both are present, the account becomes a **smart contract**.

- **Code** — the program logic that defines how the contract reacts to incoming messages.
- **Data** — the storage that keeps the contract’s state between transactions.

Smart contracts are actors: they don’t call each other directly, but exchange **messages** (transactions). This follows the **actor model**:
- Isolation: contracts cannot directly read each other’s storage.
- [Asynchronous communication](/v3/concepts/dive-into-ton/ton-blockchain/asynchrony): messages are delivered and processed independently.

## Why it matters

Smart contracts and TVM together make TON a **programmable blockchain** — not just a ledger, but a platform where apps and services can run.

Learn more about smart contracts in the [Smart contract documentation](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/overview).
