# Asynchrony

**Asynchrony** is the property of a system where events, actions, or processes happen independently, without waiting for other operations to complete.

_Asynchrony is the opposite of synchrony_, which means that operations occur one after another in a fixed order, and each step must wait for the previous one to complete before proceeding.

## Real-life example

Imagine TON as a bustling **food delivery platform**. Customers place orders by **sending requests to the platform**.

Each restaurant operates independently with **its kitchen**.
Each restaurant processes _one order at a time_.
While preparing an order, incoming new orders wait their turn — they are _not processed immediately_, ensuring the kitchen focuses entirely on the current order.

Some orders may be impossible to fulfil, for example, if ingredients are missing or if the request fails to arrive due to system issues.
In such cases, the restaurant skips the order and moves on.

Once an order is completed, the restaurant records the result in a **log**, which documents the changes,
noting exactly what was received, what was done, and the time of the order.

The key idea is that all restaurants operate _independently and asynchronously of each other_.
Some may be faster, while others may be slower; they do not wait for each other, and customers can continue placing orders without blocking the system.
Within each restaurant, orders are processed in sequence, but there’s no global order across all restaurants.


## Asynchrony in TON

In TON, the same principle applies. Instead of a food delivery platform, we have **TON Blockchain**. Instead of restaurants with kitchens, there are **accounts**. Instead of customer orders, accounts interact through **messages**. And instead of a kitchen log, each account records **transactions** that track every change in its state.

Using this analogy, we can highlight the main properties of asynchronous communication in TON:

1. **Immediate responses are not guaranteed.** A sender cannot assume a message will be answered instantly, much like a customer cannot expect their food order to arrive immediately.
2. **Senders remain non-blocking.** After sending a message, an account continues processing other messages or tasks without waiting for a reply, even if no response ever arrives — akin to a customer placing additional orders while waiting.
3. **Message order is preserved per account.** Each account processes messages in the order they are received. If a message is malformed or incomplete, it is skipped, and processing immediately continues with the following message — just as a kitchen prepares orders sequentially but moves on if an order cannot be fulfilled.
