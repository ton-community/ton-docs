# Cells

In TON, a **cell** is like a small box that can hold information.
Each box (cell) has two parts inside:

- it can keep up to **1023 bits** of data (like a small note inside the box)
- it can point to up to **4 other boxes** (arrows to other cells)

There are some rules:

- data and arrows are kept separately
- arrows cannot go in circles — a box cannot point back to itself, directly or indirectly

Because of this, all cells together form a [directed acyclic graph (DAG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph).
You can imagine it as a **family tree**: every child points to parents, but you can never circle back to your great-grandparent.

## Types of cells

There are **five types of cells** in TON.
One is the normal cell, and four are special (called [exotic](/v3/documentation/data-formats/cells/exotic)).

| Type                  | Think of it as...                     | Purpose |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|---------|
| **Ordinary cell**     | A regular box                         | Default, stores most data |
| **Pruned branch**     | A “summary” of many boxes             | Used for short proofs |
| **Library reference** | A shared folder everyone can use      | Helps avoid duplicates |
| **Merkle proof**      | A certificate attached to a box       | Used for verification |
| **Merkle update**     | A “change log” for a set of boxes     | Used for updating state |

## Serialization of data into cells

In TON, everything is stored in cells: messages, blocks, even the whole blockchain state.

All these objects are broken down into trees of cells.
This tree is called a [Bag of Cells (BoC)](/v3/documentation/data-formats/cells/overview#bag-of-cells). You can imagine it as a **set of nested boxes inside boxes**.

To describe how exactly data is put into boxes, TON uses a special language called [TL-B](/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/overviewe).
It plays the same role as **Protocol Buffers** or **JSON schemas**, but for TON cells.
