# Addresses

Every [account](/v3/concepts/dive-into-ton/ton-blockchain/accounts), including wallets and smart contracts, is represented by an address, used for all on-chain interactions.

## Components

A TON address is a composite identifier consisting of two main components:

- **WorkChain ID**: identifies a specific WorkChain (for example, MasterChain is `-1`, and BaseChain is `0`).<br/>
- **Account ID**: a unique identifier for a contract within its WorkChain.
It is derived from the hash of the contractâ€™s initial state, which includes the code and data.

For detailed technical specifications, see the [Addresses documentation](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/addresses/address).

## Formats

TON addresses are represented in two formats:

-   **Raw format**: a direct representation of the `workchain_id` and `account_id` (e.g., `-1:fcb...260`). Intended for system-level use.
-   **User-friendly format**: a base64-encoded version of the raw address that includes flags and a checksum. Designed for user interfaces, this format enhances security and prevents errors.

These formats are not interchangeable. The user-friendly format includes critical metadata, such as the _bounceable flag_, which determines message-handling behavior for uninitialized accounts.

A bounceable message sent to an address in nonexist, uninitialized or frozen state is returned to the sender. In contrast, a non-bounceable message will be credited to the account.

For a detailed breakdown of address structures, encoding, and flags, refer to the [address formats documentation](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/addresses/address-formats).


## States

Every address on TON Blockchain exists in one of four states, reflecting its lifecycle and operational status:

- `nonexist`: the initial state for all potential addresses. The address has no associated code, data, or balance.
- `uninit`: the address has received funds and has a balance but contains no smart contract code or data. It cannot execute logic.
- `active`: the address holds a balance, smart contract code, and data. It is fully operational and can process messages.
- `frozen`: the contract's storage fees have exceeded its balance, freezing its state. The address cannot execute transactions until it is unfrozen by replenishing its balance and providing its exact **previous** `state_init` (with sufficient funds for storage fees).

The address state dictates its capabilities and is fundamental to transaction processing. Further details are available in the [address states documentation](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/addresses/address-states).
