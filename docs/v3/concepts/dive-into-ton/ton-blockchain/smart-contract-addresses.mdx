# Smart contract addresses 

This document provides a high-level overview of smart contract addresses on the TON Blockchain. Every actor, including wallets and smart contracts, is represented by an address, which is essential for all on-chain interactions.

## Address components

A TON address is a composite identifier with two primary parts:

- **Workchain ID**: A signed 32-bit integer identifying the specific workchain.<br/>
The Masterchain uses `-1`, and the Basechain uses `0`.
- **Account ID**: A 256-bit unique identifier for the contract within its workchain. <br/>
It is derived from a hash of the contract's initial code and state.

For detailed technical specifications, see the [addresses documentation](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/addresses).

## Address formats

TON addresses are represented in two standard formats:

-   **Raw Format**: A direct representation of the `workchain_id` and `account_id` (e.g., `-1:fcb...260`). This format is intended for system-level use and lacks user-facing safety features.
-   **User-Friendly Format**: A Base64-encoded version of the raw address that includes flags and a checksum. This format is designed for user interfaces to enhance security and prevent errors.

These formats are not interchangeable. The user-friendly format includes critical metadata, such as bounceable flags that determine message-handling behavior for uninitialized accounts. A `bounceable` message sent to an inactive address is returned to the sender, whereas a `non-bounceable` message will credit the account.

For a detailed breakdown of address structures, encoding, and flags, refer to the [address formats documentation](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/address-formats).

## Address states

Every address on the TON Blockchain exists in one of four states, reflecting its lifecycle and operational status:

- **Nonexistent**: The initial state for all potential addresses. The address has no associated code, data, or balance.
- **Uninitialized**: The address has received funds and has a balance but contains no smart contract code or data. It cannot execute logic.
- **Active**: The address holds a balance, smart contract code, and data. It is fully operational and can process messages.
- **Frozen**: The contract's storage fees have exceeded its balance, freezing its state. The address cannot execute transactions until it is unfrozen by replenishing its balance and providing its state.

The address state dictates its capabilities and is fundamental to transaction processing. Further details are available in the [address states documentation](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/address-states).
