# Nodes

The TON Blockchain is maintained by a distributed network of **nodes**.

Some are **validators**, who produce and validate blocks. Others are **full nodes**, who keep history and serve data.

Together, these components form the backbone of TON’s decentralized architecture.

## What do nodes actually keep

Nodes maintain:

- **Blocks** — ordered chains of transactions.
- **Shard states** — the current state of accounts (balances, code, and data).
- **Proofs** — cryptographic guarantees that connect states and blocks.

This ensures that even a lite client can verify the correctness of an account’s state without trusting any single node — relying only on cryptographic proofs.

## Full nodes

A **full node** is the basic node type in TON.
It stores the blockchain history and provides access to it:

- Stores recent blocks and account states for a week or entire history (optional, depending on configuration).
- Provides APIs and data for explorers, developers, wallets, and analytics (optional).

Depending on the chosen settings for the full node:
- A full node that keeps the entire block history is called an **archive node**.
- A full node with enabled data querying is called a **liteserver**.

## Validator node

**Validators** are the backbone of consensus. They also function as full nodes but with additional responsibilities:

- Collect incoming transactions and form new blocks.
- Validate and sign blocks produced by other validators.
- Maintain the current shard state (balances, code, and data of accounts).
- Store recent blocks to extend the chain.

Validators do not need to keep the full blockchain history.
They focus on the present — ensuring new blocks are valid and properly added to the chain.

## Lite clients

A liteserver allows external applications to interact with the blockchain.
Applications that retrieve data from nodes are called **lite clients** in TON.

Lite clients enable users to access blockchain data, send external messages,
and retrieve information about blocks and transactions — for example, to fetch and update wallet balances.

Lite clients perform the following tasks:
- Download block headers.
- Verify Merkle proofs for the specific account data they need.
- Use validators’ signatures to confirm authenticity.

Lite clients make it possible to use TON securely on resource-constrained devices (like mobile phones) without trusting any single server.
