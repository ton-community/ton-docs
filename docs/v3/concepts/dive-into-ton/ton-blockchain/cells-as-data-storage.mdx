# Cells

In TON, a **cell** is a basic building block of the blockchain. A cell is a data structure with:

- stores up to **1023 bits** of data
- maintains up to **4 references** to other cells
- bits and references stored separately
- no circular references: none of a cell’s descendants may reference the original cell.

Thus, all cells constitute a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The following diagram illustrates this structure.

## Cell types

Currently, there are five types of cells: one ordinary cell and four exotic cells.
The exotic types are:


- Pruned branch cell
- Library reference cell
- Merkle proof cell
- Merkle update cell

## Cell flavors

A cell is an opaque object optimized for compact storage.

Cells are deduplicated: if several equivalent sub-cells are referenced in different branches, their content is stored only once. See [Library cells](/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/library-cells). However, one cannot modify or read a cell directly because of its opacity. Thus, there are two additional flavors of a cell:

- Builder: used for constructing cells.
- Slice: used for reading cells.

Another unique cell flavor in TVM:

- Continuation — cells containing opcodes for the **TON Virtual Machine (TVM)**; see [TVM overview](/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-overview).

## Serialization of data into cells

Any object in TON—such as a message, block, or the whole blockchain state—serializes into a tree of cells ([Bag of Cells](/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/cell-boc#bag-of-cells));

A TL-B scheme describes the serialization process: a formal description of how this object can be serialized into a builder or parsed from a slice.
TL-B for cells plays a role similar to TL or Protocol Buffers for byte streams.

For more details about cell serialization and deserialization, see the article ‘[Cell & bag of cells](/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/cell-boc)’.
