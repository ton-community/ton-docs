# Overview

The TON Virtual Machine (TVM) executes all TON smart contracts. TVM operates as a **stack machine**, which ensures efficiency and ease of implementation.

This document provides a high-level overview of how TVM processes transactions.

## TON Blockchain course

The [TON Blockchain course](/v3/concepts/educational-resources#ton-blockchain-development) is a comprehensive guide to TON Blockchain development. Module 2 covers **TVM**, transactions, scalability, and business cases in detail.

Before starting the course, ensure you have a solid understanding of blockchain basics. If you need to fill knowledge gaps, consider taking the [Blockchain basics](/v3/concepts/educational-resources#blockchain-basics) course.

## Transactions and phases

When an event occurs on an account in TON Blockchain, it triggers a **transaction**. The most common event is receiving a message, but other events like `tick-tock`, `merge`, and `split` can also initiate transactions.

Each transaction consists of up to five phases:

1. **Storage phase**: calculates storage fees for the contract based on the space it occupies in the blockchain state. Learn more in [storage fees](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/transaction-fees/fees-low-level#storage-fee).
2. **Credit phase**: updates the contract's balance by accounting for incoming message values and storage fees.
3. **Compute phase**: executes the contract code on TVM. The result includes `exit_code`, `actions`, `gas_details`, `new_storage`, and other data.
4. **Action phase**: processes actions from the compute phase if it succeeds. Actions may include sending messages, updating contract code, or modifying libraries. Suppose an action fails, for example, due to a lack of funds. In that case, the transaction may revert or skip the action, depending on its [mode](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/message-management/message-modes-cookbook). For example, `mode = 0, flag = 2` means that any errors arising while processing this message during the action phase are ignored.
5. **Bounce phase**: if the compute or action phase ends with an error and the inbound message has the bounce flag set, this phase generates a bounce message.

## Compute phase

The compute phase involves executing the contract code on TVM.

### When the compute phase is skipped

The compute phase may be skipped under certain conditions, such as when the account is missing, uninitialized, or frozen, or when the incoming message lacks code or data fields. These scenarios are represented by specific constructors:

- `cskip_no_state$00`: the account or message lacks a valid state (for example, [missing code or data](https://testnet.tonviewer.com/transaction/7e78394d082882375a5d21affa6397dec60fc5a3ecbea87f401b0e460fb5c80c)).
- `cskip_bad_state$01`: the message contains an invalid state (for example, incorrect hash) for a frozen or uninitialized account.
- `cskip_no_gas$10`: the account lacks enough funds to cover gas costs.

### TVM state

At any point, the TVM state is defined by six properties:
- **Stack**: a last-in-first-out data structure.
- **Control registers**: up to 16 variables that can be directly accessed during execution.
- **Current continuation**: describes the sequence of instructions being executed.
- **Current codepage**: specifies the TVM version in use.
- **Gas limits**: includes the current gas limit (g<sub>l</sub>), maximum gas limit (g<sub>m</sub>), remaining gas (g<sub>r</sub>), and gas credit (g<sub>c</sub>).
- **Library context**: a hashmap of libraries available for TVM.

### Types

TVM operates as a stack machine, supporting seven variable types:
- **Non-cell types**:
  - Integer: signed 257-bit integers.
  - Tuple: ordered collections of up to 255 elements.
  - Null.
- **Cell types**:
  - Cell: basic data structure for storing information.
  - Slice: allows reading data from a cell.
  - Builder: enables creating new cells.
  - Continuation: treats a cell as a source of TVM instructions.

### Control registers

- `c0`: stores the next or return continuation, similar to a return address.
- `c1`: stores the alternative continuation.
- `c2`: contains the exception handler. Continuation.
- `c3`: holds the smart contract code. Cell.
- `c4`: stores the persistent data (contract's `data` section). Cell.
- `c5`: contains output actions. Cell.
- `c7`: stores temporary data. Tuple.

### Initializing TVM

TVM initializes during the compute phase and executes commands/opcodes from the **current continuation** until no more commands remain. For a detailed explanation, see [TVM initialization](/v3/documentation/tvm/initialization).

## TVM instructions

For a complete list of instructions, visit [TVM instructions](/v3/documentation/tvm/instructions).

### Results of TVM execution

Besides `exit_code` and gas consumption, TVM outputs:
- `c4`: the new `data` cell for the contract (if execution succeeds).
- `c5`: a cell containing output actions.

Other register values are discarded. Note:
- `c4` and `c5` must not exceed a depth of `512`.
- A contract can't create more than 255 output actions.

:::tip
To send more than 255 messages, a contract can send a message to itself with a request to process the remaining messages. See an example in the [highload wallet contract](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/highload-wallet-contract-v3/blob/main/contracts/highload-wallet-v3.func#L50).
