# RUNVM Specification
Currently there is no way for code in TVM to call external untrusted code "in sandbox". In other words, external code always can irreversibly update code, data of contract, or set actions (such as sending all money).

`RUNVM` instruction allows to spawn an independent VM instance, run desired code and get needed data (stack, registers, gas consumption etc) without risks of polluting caller's state. Running arbitrary code in a safe way may be useful for [v4-style plugins](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/contracts-specs/wallet-contracts#wallet-v4), Tact's `init` style subcontract calculation etc.

Flags are similar to `runvmx` in fift:
- `+1`: set c3 to code
- `+2`: push an implicit 0 before running the code
- `+4`: take `c4` from stack (persistent data), return its final value
- `+8`: take gas limit `g_l` from stack, return consumed gas `g_c`
- `+16`: take `c7` from stack (smart-contract context)
- `+32`: return final value of `c5` (actions)
- `+64`: pop hard gas limit (enabled by ACCEPT) `g_m` from stack
- `+128`: "isolated gas consumption". Child VM will have a separate set of visited cells and a separate chksgn counter.
- `+256`: pop integer `r`, return exactly `r` values from the top:
- If RUNVM call successful and r is set, it returns r elements. If r not set - returns all;
- if RUNVM successful but there is not enough elements on stack (stack depth less than r) it is considered as exception in child VM, with exit_code=-3 and exit_arg=0 (so 0 is returned as only stack element);
- if RUNVM fails with exception - only one element is returned - exit arg (not to be mistaken with exit_code);
- in case of OOG, exit_code = -14 and exit_arg is amount of gas.

Gas cost:
- 66 gas
- 1 gas for every stack element given to the child VM (first 32 are free)
- 1 gas for every stack element returned from the child VM (first 32 are free)
