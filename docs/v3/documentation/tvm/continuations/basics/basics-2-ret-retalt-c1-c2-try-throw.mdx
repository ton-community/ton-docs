# Continuations: Basics 2: RET, RETALT, c1, c2, TRY, THROW

In the [previous article](./basics-1-if-c0-cc-savelist/), we explored the `c0` register and its role in control flow. In this article, we'll look at the other two control registers: `c1` (alternative return) and `c2` (exception handler).

While the first article focused on the normal exit point of a continuation (when its code ends or `RET` is called), every continuation actually has three distinct exit points.

## Normal exit point (c0)

As a brief recap, the normal exit point is handled by the `c0` register. When a continuation finishes, TVM executes the continuation stored in `c0`. Instructions like `RET` or `IFRET` trigger this explicitly.

```
PUSHINT 4
PUSHINT -1
PUSHCONT {
  EQINT 4 // 4 (from above) == 4 (here)
  IFRET // if true -> return
}
IF
// ...
```

This code actually looks like we are exiting the entire program, but in reality, we are just ending the execution of the current continuation. In a high-level language, this might look like:

```kotlin
if (4 == 4) block@{
  break@block
}
// ...
```

## Alternative exit point (c1)

We already know that `c0` contains the continuation which TVM will execute in the case of a normal continuation completion. The `c1` register, on the other hand, contains the continuation to which a jump will be made in the case of an **alternative** completion. For alternative exit points, instructions like `RETALT`, `IFRETALT`, and `IFNOTRETALT` are used.

An alternative exit may seem strange at first, but it is a powerful feature of TVM as it allows for expressing complex control flow. In fact, you have already encountered alternative exit points in high-level languages. 

Consider the following code:

```C++
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  // ... point 1
  if (i == 5) {
    continue; // -> point 1
  }
  if (i > 7) {
    break; // -> point 2
  }
  // ...
}
// ... point 2
```

This code clearly shows that the loop code actually has two exit points: one is to exit the current iteration and continue to the next (if the condition is true), and the other is to terminate the entire loop.

Let's look at a simple loop in TVM:

```
PUSHINT 4 // iteration count
PUSHCONT {
  PUSHINT 1
}
REPEAT
```

What if we want to exit the loop early if a certain condition is true? A simple approach won't work:

```
PUSHINT 4 // iteration count
PUSHCONT {
  PUSHINT 1
  PUSHINT 2
  EQUAL
  IFNOTRET // break?

  PUSHINT 1
}
REPEAT
// ...
```

Because this is actually an implementation of... `continue`! The `REPEAT` instruction executes the continuation N times, so when we called `IFNOTRET`, we simply terminated the **current** iteration, just like `continue` does.

But what if we still want to implement `break`? Let's think conceptually about what we want. If `RET` simply ends the current continuation, we need another exit that will jump to the code immediately after `REPEAT`, discarding the current continuation. Fortunately, loop instructions in TVM have special additional instructions ending with `BRK` that do exactly what we need. `REPEATBRK` will set `c1` to `cc`, just like `IF` sets `c0` to return to the code after the `IF`.

```
PUSHINT 4 // iteration count
PUSHCONT {
  PUSHINT 1
  PUSHINT 2
  EQUAL
  IFNOTRETALT // break!

  PUSHINT 1
}
REPEATBRK
// ...
```

And now, by using `IFNOTRETALT`, we can exit the loop and continue executing the code after the loop.

`c0` and `c1` are similar; they both describe the code that will be executed upon exiting a continuation, but they describe different exit points. 

## Exception exit point (c2)

Finally, let's look at the third exit point. While the first two handle normal and alternative control flow, the third handles abnormal control flow. This is managed by the `c2` register, which holds the **exception handler continuation**.

Consider the following code:

```
PUSHINT -1
THROWIF 10
```

If we execute this, we will get `default exception handler, terminating vm with exit code 10`. Since we explicitly threw an exception, TVM transferred control to the continuation from `c2`. By default, `c2` contains a special `ExcQuitCont` which prints the message above and terminates execution with the given exit code.

But what if we want to handle the exception ourselves? For this, there is the `TRY` instruction:

```
PUSHCONT {
  // body
}
PUSHCONT {
  // handler
}
TRY
```

This instruction sets the value of `c2` to the continuation from the top of the stack and then calls the next continuation on the stack. Thus, since `c2` now points to our continuation, if we throw an exception in the body, TVM will call our continuation and pass the exception code to it:

```
PUSHCONT {
  THROW 10
}
PUSHCONT { // on stack: [10]
  // ...
}
TRY
```

The `TRY` instruction does the following:

1. It sets the new value of `c2` while saving the old value in the save list of the continuation that represents the handler, and also saving it in the save list of the current continuation.

2. It transfers control to the body continuation.
3. If there was no exception inside the body, the continuation completes normally (we return to the continuation after `TRY`), and `c2` is restored to the saved value.
4. If there was an exception, TVM executes the handler continuation, passing the exit code on the stack. In this case, `c2` inside the handler is set to the old `c2` value, which allows for re-throwing, as any `THROW` inside the handler will be handled by the old handler.

Let's look at an example with re-throwing:

```
PUSHCONT {
  THROW 10
}
PUSHCONT {   // on stack: [10]
  DUP        // [10, 10]
  EQINT 10   // [10, -1]
  THROWANYIF // re-throw all exceptions with code 10
}
TRY
```

`THROWANYIF` is an instruction that takes a number from the stack and throws an exception if top of the stack is equal to -1.

Let's summarize what we've learned:

- Every continuation has three exit points, controlled by registers `c0`, `c1`, and `c2`.
- `c0` handles the normal return path, `c1` handles an alternative path, and `c2` handles exceptions.
- With these points, you can implement complex control flow such as break/continue and throw/re-throw.
