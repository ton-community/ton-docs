# Manual handling and JMP vs. EXECUTE

In the [previous article](./diving-deeper-exit-points-of-continuations), we explored how TVM uses control registers (`c0`, `c1`, `c2`) automatically. In this part of the basics series, we'll see how to manipulate these registers directly using `PUSHCTR` and `POPCTR`, and clarify the crucial difference between the `JMP` and `EXECUTE` families of instructions.

## Manual register control: PUSHCTR and POPCTR

`PUSHCTR` pushes a copy of a control register's value (which is a continuation for `c0`, `c1`, or `c2`) onto the stack. `POPCTR` pops a continuation from the stack and sets it as the new value for a control register.

These instructions give you fine-grained control over the flow of your program. For example, while `TRY` is the standard way to handle exceptions, you could set an exception handler manually:

```
PUSHCONT { // stack: [10]
  // handler
}
POPCTR c2
THROW 10
```
However, `TRY` does more than just set `c2`; it also manages the `save list` to handle re-throwing and state rollbacks, which a manual `POPCTR` does not.

To simulate at least some of the behavior of `TRY`, you can use the following code:

```
// outer continuation like body of the TRY
PUSHCONT { // stack: [MainCont]
  // handler continuation
  PUSHCONT { // stack: [MainCont, 10]
    // ... code of the handler
     
    // epilog to make it work
    DEPTH DEC ROLL // get cc from the bottom of the stack
    POPCTR c0 // reset c0 with MainCont to return to main code
  }
  POPCTR c2

  // body code
  THROWARG 10
}
CALLCC

// code after pseudo TRY
PUSHINT 9
```

The `CALLCC` instruction calls a continuation from the stack while passing the old `cc` (the "main contract code" in this example) onto the stack for the new continuation to use. In the example, we then manually set `c2` to catch exceptions. The handler's logic retrieves the saved `cc` and places it into `c0`, ensuring that after the handler is done, execution returns to the code after the `CALLCC` call.

The `PUSHCTR` instruction provides another way to manage context. Instead of passing `cc` into the continuation, we can use `PUSHCTR c0` to save the return address *before* we enter the new continuation. Let's see how that simplifies the code:

```
// outer continuation like body of the TRY
PUSHCONT {     // stack: []
  PUSHCTR c0 // [MainCont]

  // handler continuation
  PUSHCONT { // stack: [MainCont, 10]
    // ... code of the handler

    // epilog to make it work
    DEPTH DEC ROLL // get cc from the bottom of the stack
    POPCTR c0 // reset c0 with MainCont to return to main code
  }
  POPCTR c2

  // body code
  THROWARG 10
}
EXECUTE

// code after pseudo TRY
PUSHINT 9
```

This code achieves a similar result. The key difference is that it uses `EXECUTE`. As we'll see next, `EXECUTE` automatically handles setting up the return continuation (`c0`), making it a more common choice for this kind of "subroutine" call.

## JMP vs. EXECUTE

A key concept in TVM control flow is the difference between `JMP` and `EXECUTE`. Both transfer control to a new continuation, but they handle the return path (`c0`) differently.

### EXECUTE family: call and return

Instructions like `EXECUTE`, `IF`, `REPEAT`, and `CALL` belong to the `EXECUTE` family. Think of them as a standard function call. Before jumping to the new continuation, they **automatically save the current continuation (`cc`) into `c0`**. This ensures that when the called continuation finishes, execution returns right back to where it left off.

### JMP family: one-way jump

Instructions like `JMPX`, `IFJMP`, and `CALLCC` belong to the `JMP` family. Think of them as a `goto`. They **do not touch the `c0` register**; they simply jump to the new continuation, leaving `c0` as it is. If `c0` held the default exit handler, the program will terminate after the new continuation finishes.

While the `JMP` family doesn't set `c0` automatically, you can always set it manually with `POPCTR` before the jump if needed.

Let's summarize what we've learned:

- `PUSHCTR` and `POPCTR` allow for direct manipulation of control registers.
- The `EXECUTE` family of instructions works like a "call", saving the return address in `c0`.
- The `JMP` family of instructions works like a "goto", leaving `c0` untouched.

<summary>Bonus question: What happens if you `JMPX` to a continuation that immediately calls `RET`?</summary>

> The `RET` instruction simply executes the continuation currently in the `c0` register. Since `JMPX` does not modify `c0`, the `RET` would cause a jump to wherever `c0` was pointing *before* the `JMPX` occurred.
