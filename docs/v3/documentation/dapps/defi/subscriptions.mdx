# Content subscriptions

Because transactions on the TON blockchain are fast and network fees are low, you can process recurring payments on-chain via smart contracts.

For example, users can subscribe to digital content (or anything else) and be charged a monthly fee of 1 Toncoin (TON).

:::tip
This feature requires Wallet v4. Older wallets don’t support plugins; behavior is subject to change in future versions.

:::warning
A subscription plugin requires authorization exactly once, upon installation; after that, it can transfer Toncoin without further user confirmation. Do your own research before authorizing unknown subscriptions. Users cannot have a subscription installed without their knowledge.

## Example flow

- Users with [Wallet v4](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/contracts-specs/wallet-contracts#wallet-v4) can install additional smart contracts (plugins) to extend wallet functionality.

After reviewing plugin functionality, users can approve trusted smart contract (plugin) addresses for their wallet. After approval, trusted smart contracts can withdraw Toncoin from the wallet. This is similar to infinite approval in some other blockchains.

- An intermediate subscription smart contract, deployed as a wallet plugin, sits between each user and the service.

This smart contract guarantees that a specified amount of Toncoin will be debited from a user's wallet at most once per specified period.

- The backend initiates a charge by sending an external message to the user’s subscription smart contract.

- Either the user or the service can decide they no longer need a subscription and terminate it.

## Smart contract examples

- [Wallet v4 smart contract source code](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/wallet-contract/blob/3fd1d7ae39f1c46ec1f2be54c4040d8d87505e0f/func/wallet-v4-code.fc)
- [Subscription smart contract source code](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/wallet-contract/blob/3fd1d7ae39f1c46ec1f2be54c4040d8d87505e0f/func/simple-subscription-plugin.fc)

## Implementation

A good example is Toncoin-powered subscriptions to private Telegram channels via the [@donate](https://t.me/donate) bot and the [Tonkeeper wallet](https://tonkeeper.com).
