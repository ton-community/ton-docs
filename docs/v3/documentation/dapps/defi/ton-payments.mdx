# TON Payments

TON Payments is the platform for payment channels.

It allows instant payments without the need to commit all transactions to the blockchain, pay the associated transaction fees (e.g., for the gas consumed), and wait for block confirmation.

Because the overall expense of such instant payments is so minimal, they can be used for micropayments in games, APIs, and off-chain apps. [See examples](#examples).
