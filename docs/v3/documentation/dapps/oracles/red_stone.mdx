# RedStone Oracles

## How RedStone oracles work with TON

RedStone oracles use an alternative design of providing oracle data to smart contracts. Instead of constantly persisting data on the contract's storage (by data providers), the information is brought on-chain only when needed (by end users). Until that moment data remains in the decentralized cache layer, which is powered by RedStone light cache gateways and
streams data broadcasting protocol. Data is transferred to the contract by end users, who should attach signed data
packages to their function invocations. The information integrity is verified on-chain through signature checking.

To learn more about RedStone oracles design go to the [RedStone docs](https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/introduction)

## Smart Contracts

### price_manager.fc

- Sample oracle contract that consumes RedStone oracles data [price_manager.fc](https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-oracles-monorepo/blob/main/packages/ton-connector/contracts/price_manager.fc) written in
  FunC. It requires [TVM Upgrade 2023.07](/v3/documentation/tvm/changelog/tvm-upgrade-2023-07).

#### initial data

As mentioned above, the data packages transferred to the contract are being verified by signature checking.
To be counted to achieve the `signer_count_threshold`, the signer signing the passed data
should be one of the `signers` passed in the initial data. There is also needed `signer_count_threshold` to be
passed.

Due to the architecture of TON contracts, the initial data must convene with the contract's storage structure,
which is constructed as below:

```ts
  begin_cell()
    .store_uint(signer_count_threshold, 8)  /// number as passed below
    .store_uint(timestamp, TIMESTAMP_BITS)  /// initially 0 representing the epoch 0
    .store_ref(signers)                     /// serialized tuple of values passed below
  .end_cell();
```

The value of `signers` should be passed as a serialized `tuple` of `int`s.
See [tuple](https://github.com/ton-core/ton-core/blob/main/src/tuple/tuple.ts).

<!-- To define the initial (storage) data for the Prices contract, use the predefined
class [PriceManagerInitData.ts](../src/price-manager/PriceManagerInitData.ts). -->

In the function parameters below, each `feed_id` is a string encoded to `int` which means, that's a value
consisting of hex-values of the particular letters in the string. For example:
`'ETH'` as an `int` is `0x455448` in hex or `4543560` in decimal, as `256*256*ord('E')+256*ord('T')+ord('H')`.

You can use: `feed_id=hexlify(toUtf8Bytes(feed_string))` to convert particular values or
the [endpoint](https://cairo-utils-web.vercel.app/)

The value of `feed_ids`  should be passed as a serialized `tuple` of `int`s.

The value `payload` is packed from an array of bytes representing the serialized RedStone payload.
See [TON RedStone payload packing](#ton-redstone-payload-packing) section below, as well as the file [constants.fc](https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-oracles-monorepo/blob/main/packages/ton-connector/contracts/redstone/constants.fc), containing all needed `int`-length constants.

#### get_prices

```func
(cell) get_prices_v2(cell data_feed_ids, cell payload) method_id;
```

The function process on-chain the `payload` passed as an argument
and returns a `cell` of aggregated values of each feed passed as an identifier inside `feed_ids`.

Due to HTTP GET method length limitation in TON API v4, the function is written for TON API v2.

That are just a `method_id` functions - they don't modify the contract's storage and don't consume TONs.

#### OP_REDSTONE_WRITE_PRICES

Regardless of the on-fly processing, there also exists a method for processing the `payload` on-chain, but
saving/writing the aggregated values to the contract's storage. The values persist in the contract's storage and then can be read by using `read_prices` function. The timestamp of data last saved/written to the contract is able to read by using the `read_timestamp` function.

The method must be invoked as a TON internal message. The arguments of the message are:

- an `int` representing RedStone_Write_Prices name hashed by keccak256 as defined
  in [constants.ts](https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-oracles-monorepo/blob/main/packages/ton-connector/src/config/constants.ts)
- a `cell` - ref representing the `data_feed_ids` as a serialized `tuple` of `int`s.\
- a `cell` - ref representing the packed RedStone payload

```func
    int op = in_msg_body~load_uint(OP_NUMBER_BITS);

    if (op == OP_REDSTONE_WRITE_PRICES) {
        cell data_feeds_cell = in_msg_body~load_ref();
        cell payload_cell = in_msg_body~load_ref();

    // ...
    }
```

That's an internal message - it consumes GAS and modifies the contract's storage, so must be paid by TONs.

See how it works on: https://ton-showroom.redstone.finance/

#### read_prices

```func
(tuple) read_prices(tuple data_feed_ids) method_id;
```

The function reads the values persisting in the contract's storage and returns a tuple corresponding to the
passed `feed_ids`.
The function doesn't modify the storage and can read only aggregated values of the `feed_ids` saved by
using `write_prices` function.

That's just a `method_id` function - it doesn't modify the contract's storage and don't consume TONs.

#### read_timestamp

```func
(int) read_timestamp() method_id;
```

Returns the timestamp of data last saved/written to the contract's storage by using `OP_REDSTONE_WRITE_PRICES` message.

That's just a `method_id` function - it doesn't modify the contract's storage and don't consume TONs.

### price_feed.fc

Due to the architecture of TON contracts, the initial data must convene with the contract's storage structure,
which is constructed as below:

```ts
beginCell()
  .storeUint(BigInt(hexlify(toUtf8Bytes(this.feedId))), consts.DATA_FEED_ID_BS * 8)
  .storeAddress(Address.parse(this.managerAddress))
  .storeUint(0, consts.DEFAULT_NUM_VALUE_BS * 8)  /// initially 0 representing the epoch 0
  .storeUint(0, consts.TIMESTAMP_BS * 8)
  .endCell();
```

To define the initial (storage) data for the Price feed contract, use the predefined
class [PriceFeedInitData.ts](https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-oracles-monorepo/blob/main/packages/ton-connector/src/price-feed/PriceFeedInitData.ts).

#### OP_REDSTONE_FETCH_DATA

Regardless of reading the values persisting in the contract's from outside the network,
there is a possibility for fetching the value stored in the contract for a `feed_id` on-chain directly.
There must be invoked an internal message `OP_REDSTONE_FETCH_DATA`. The arguments of the message are:

* an `int` representing `RedStone_Fetch_Data` name hashed by keccak256 as defined
  in [constants.ts](https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-oracles-monorepo/blob/main/packages/ton-connector/src/config/constants.ts)
* an `int` representing the `feed_id` value.
* a `slice` representing the `initial_sender` of the message, to allow they carried the remaining transaction balance
  when the returning transaction goes.

```func
    int op = in_msg_body~load_uint(OP_NUMBER_BITS);

    if (op == OP_REDSTONE_FETCH_DATA) {
        int feed_id = in_msg_body~load_uint(DATA_FEED_ID_BITS);
        cell initial_payload = in_msg_body~load_ref();

        // ...
    }
```

The returning message `OP_REDSTONE_DATA_FETCHED` message is sent to the sender, containing the `value` and
the `timestamp` of the value has saved. The message can be then fetched in the sender and processed or saved in the
sender's storage.
The initial payload's `ref` (`initial_payload`) is added as a ref - containing for example the first message's sender,
to allow they carry the remaining transaction balance.

```ts
begin_cell()
  .store_uint(value, MAX_VALUE_SIZE_BITS)
  .store_uint(timestamp, TIMESTAMP_BITS)
  .store_ref(initial_payload)
  .end_cell()
```

That's an internal message - it consumes GAS and modifies the contract's storage, so must be paid by TONs.

#### get_price_and_timestamp

```func
(int, int) get_price_and_timestamp() method_id;
```

Returns the value and timestamp of the last saved/written data to the adapter's storage by sending `OP_REDSTONE_FETCH_DATA` message and fetching the returned value of the `OP_REDSTONE_DATA_FETCHED` message.

That's just a `method_id` function - it doesn't modify the contract's storage and don't consume TONs.

### single_feed_man.fc

#### initial data

Similar to the `prices` and `price_feed` initial data. Due to the architecture of TON contracts, the initial data must convene with the contract's storage structure, which is constructed as below:

```ts
beginCell()
  .storeUint(BigInt(hexlify(toUtf8Bytes(this.feedId))), consts.DATA_FEED_ID_BS * 8)
  .storeUint(this.signerCountThreshold, SIGNER_COUNT_THRESHOLD_BITS)
  .storeUint(0, consts.DEFAULT_NUM_VALUE_BS * 8)
  .storeUint(0, consts.TIMESTAMP_BS * 8)
  .storeRef(serializeTuple(createTupleItems(this.signers)))
  .endCell();
```

To define the initial (storage) data for the Prices contract, use the predefined
class [SingleFeedManInitData.ts](https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-oracles-monorepo/blob/main/packages/ton-connector/src/single-feed-man/SingleFeedManInitData.ts).

A contract like `price_manager`, but supporting
the single feed only, to omit the communication needs between feed and manager contracts.

#### get_price

```func
(int, int) get_price(cell payload) method_id;
```

Similar to `get_prices`, but omitting the first (`data_feed_ids`) argument as have it configured during
the initialization. Returns also the min timestamp of the passed data packages.

#### read_price_and_timestamp

```func
(int, int) read_price_and_timestamp() method_id;
```

Works as the `get_price_and_timestamp` function.

#### OP_REDSTONE_WRITE_PRICE

Similar to `OP_REDSTONE_WRITE_PRICES`, but omitting the first (`data_feed_ids`) `cell`-ref as have it configured during the initialization.

```func
    int op = in_msg_body~load_uint(OP_NUMBER_BITS);

    if (op == OP_REDSTONE_WRITE_PRICE) {
        cell payload_cell = in_msg_body~load_ref();

        // ...
    }
```

### sample_consumer.fc

A sample consumer for data stored in the `price_feed`. Works also with `single_feed_man`.
The `price_feed` to be called needs to be passed.

#### initial data

Similar to the `price_feed` initial data. Due to the architecture of TON contracts, the initial data must convene with the contract's storage structure, which is constructed as below:

```ts
beginCell()
  .storeAddress(Address.parse(this.feedAddress))
  .endCell();
```

To define the initial (storage) data for the Prices contract, use the predefined
class [SampleConsumerInitData.ts](https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-oracles-monorepo/blob/main/packages/ton-connector/src/sample-consumer/SampleConsumerInitData.ts).

The contract calls the single feed.

#### OP_REDSTONE_READ_DATA

There is a possibility for fetching the value stored in the contract for a `feed_id` on-chain directly.
There must be invoked an internal message `OP_REDSTONE_READ_DATA`. The arguments of the message are:

* a `slice` representing the `initial_sender` of the message, to allow they carried the remaining transaction balance
  when the returning transaction goes.

```func
    int op = in_msg_body~load_uint(OP_NUMBER_BITS);

    if (op == OP_REDSTONE_READ_DATA) {
        cell initial_payload = in_msg_body~load_ref();

        // ...
    }
```

The returning message `OP_REDSTONE_DATA_READ` message is sent to the sender, containing the `feed_id`, `value` and
the `timestamp` of the value has saved. The message can be then fetched in the sender and processed or saved in the
sender's storage.
The initial payload's `ref` (`initial_payload`) is added as a ref - containing for example the first message's sender,
to allow they carry the remaining transaction balance.

```ts
begin_cell()
  .store_uint(value, MAX_VALUE_SIZE_BITS)
  .store_uint(timestamp, TIMESTAMP_BITS)
  .store_ref(initial_payload)
  .end_cell()
```

That's an internal message - it consumes GAS and modifies the contract's storage, so must be paid by TONs.

## TON RedStone Payload packing

Due to limitations of the Bag-size in TON [see](/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/cell-boc),
the RedStone payload data - represented as a hex string - needed to be passed to a contract in a more complex way.

Having the RedStone payload as defined [here](https://docs.redstone.finance/img/payload.png),
the data should be passed as a Cell built as follows.

1. The main *payload* `cell` consists of:
    1. the metadata in the **data-level bits** consisting of the parts as on the image:

      ![payload-metadata.png](/img/docs/oracles/red-stone/payload-metadata.png)
    1. a **ref** containing a `udict` indexed by consecutive natural numbers (beginning from 0) containing the list of **data_package** `cell`s.
1. Each *data-package* `cell` consists of:
    1. the data package's signature in the **data-level bits**:

      ![payload-metadata.png](/img/docs/oracles/red-stone/payload-metadata.png)
    1. one **ref** to a `cell` containing the data of the rest of the data package on its **data-level**:

      ![payload-metadata.png](/img/docs/oracles/red-stone/data-package-data.png)

#### Current implementation limitations

* The RedStone payload must be fetched by explicitly defining data feeds,
  which leads to **one data point** belonging to **one data package**.
* The unsigned metadata size must not be exceeding `127 - (2 + 3 + 9) = 113` bytes.

#### Helper

The ```createPayloadCell``` method in the [create-payload-cell.ts](https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-oracles-monorepo/blob/main/packages/ton-connector/src/create-payload-cell.ts) file
checks the limitations and prepares the data to be sent to the contract as described above.

#### Sample serialization

The image below contains data for `2` feeds times `2` unique signers:
![payload-metadata.png](/img/docs/oracles/red-stone/sample-serialization.png)

## Possible transaction failures

* The number of signers recovered from the signatures matched with ```addresses``` passed in the initializer
  must be greater or equal that the ```signer_count_threshold``` in the constructor, for each feed.
    * Otherwise, it panics then with the `300` error, increased by the first index of the passed
      feed which has broken the validation.
* The timestamp of data-packages must be not older than 15 minutes in relation to the ```block_timestamp```.
    * Otherwise, it panics then with the `200` error, increased by the first index of the payload's
      data package which has broken the validation, increased additionally by `50` if the package's timestamp is too
      future.
* The internal messages consume gas and must be paid by TONs. The data are available on the contract
  just after the transaction successes.
* The other error codes are defined [here](https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-oracles-monorepo/blob/main/packages/ton-connector/src/config/constants.ts)
