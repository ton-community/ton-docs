# Toncoin

The native cryptocurrency of TON Ecosystem is **Toncoin**. Transaction fees, gas fees, and storage fees are paid in Toncoin. Toncoin is used for staking to become a validator.

- The process of making Toncoin payments is described in [Payments processing](/v3/guidelines/dapps/asset-processing/payments-processing).
- You can find where to buy or exchange Toncoin on the [Toncoin page](https://ton.org/coin).

## Toncoin currency architecture

Toncoin is integrated into the base layer of the TON blockchain protocol.

```tlb

account$1 addr:MsgAddressInt storage_stat:StorageInfo
          storage:AccountStorage = Account;

account_storage$_ last_trans_lt:uint64
    balance:CurrencyCollection state:AccountState 
  = AccountStorage;
  
```

Each account has an associated balance in nanoTON (1 TON = 1,000,000,000 nanoTON). Thanks to this account, keep own `balance` even without a deployed contract.
