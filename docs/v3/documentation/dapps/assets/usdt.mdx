# USDT

## Tether

On [Apr 18, 2023](https://t.me/toncoin/824), Tether publicly launched the USDT (USD₮) token. See <a href="https://tether.to/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tether</a>.

On the TON Blockchain, USDT is supported as a [jetton](/v3/guidelines/dapps/asset-processing/jettons) based on [stablecoin contract](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/stablecoin-contract).

:::info
To integrate Tether’s USDT on TON Blockchain, use the jetton master address:

## Advantages of USDT on TON

### Seamless Telegram integration

[USDT on TON](https://ton.org/borderless) integrates with Telegram to provide a user-friendly experience for USDT transfers and DeFi.

### Lower transaction fees

Fees for Ethereum USDT transfers are calculated dynamically depending on a network load. This is why transactions can become expensive.

```cpp
transaction_fee = gas_used * gas_price
```

- `gas_used` is the amount of gas used during transaction execution.
- `gas_price` is the cost of one unit of gas in Gwei, calculated dynamically.

On the other hand average fee for sending any amount of USDT in TON Blockchain is about 0.0145 TON nowadays. Even if the price of TON increases 100 times, transactions will remain ultra-cheap. see the [average transaction cost](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/transaction-fees/fees#average-transaction-cost).

### Fast and scalable

TON’s high throughput and rapid confirmation times enable fast USDT transactions.

## Advanced details

:::caution IMPORTANT
On the TON Blockchain, multiple jettons can share the same name; a counterfeit jetton may look identical to the real USDT but has no value. Verify legitimacy by confirming the jetton master address.

See important [recommendations](/v3/guidelines/dapps/asset-processing/jettons).
