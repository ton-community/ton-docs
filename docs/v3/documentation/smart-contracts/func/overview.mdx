# Overview

FunC is minimalist, domain-specific, functional-style language designed for writing low-level TON smart contracts, tightly bound to the TVM model.

Here is a simple example of a method for sending money written in FunC:

```func
() send_money(slice address, int amount) impure inline {
    var msg = begin_cell()
        .store_uint(0x10, 6) ;; nobounce
        .store_slice(address)
        .store_coins(amount)
        .end_cell();

    send_raw_message(msg, 64);
}
```

The compiler converts FunC programs into Fift assembler code, generating the corresponding bytecode for the [TON Virtual Machine](/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-overview/).

Developers and engineers can use its bytecode, which is structured as a [tree of cells](/v3/concepts/dive-into-ton/ton-blockchain/cells-as-data-storage/) like all data in the TON Blockchain, to create smart contracts or run it on a local instance of the TVM.

## Compiler

### Blueprint

Using the Blueprint framework is the most convenient and quickest way to begin developing and compiling smart contracts.
Read more in the [Blueprint](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/getting-started/javascript/) section.

### GitHub

FunC binaries can be downloaded from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/releases) or [compiled manually](/v3/guidelines/smart-contracts/howto/compile/compilation-instructions#func) from sources.

## Tutorials

:::tip starter tip
The best place to start developing on TON is the [Quick start](/v3/guidelines/quick-start/getting-started) section.
:::

The [TON Blockchain course](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/overview#ton-blockchain-course) includes Module 4,
which covers FunC and smart contract development.
