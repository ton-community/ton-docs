# Overview

**FunC** is a high-level language used to program smart contracts on TON.

FunC is a domain-specific, C-like, statically typed language. Here is a simple example of a method for sending money written in FunC:

```c
() send_money(slice address, int amount) impure inline {
    var msg = begin_cell()
        .store_uint(0x10, 6) ;; nobounce
        .store_slice(address)
        .store_coins(amount)
        .end_cell();

    send_raw_message(msg, 64);
}
```

## Compiler

The compiler converts FunC programs into Fift assembler code, generating the corresponding bytecode for the [TON Virtual Machine](/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-overview/).

Developers can use this bytecode, which is structured as a [Bag of Cells](/v3/documentation/data-formats/cells/overview) like all data in the TON Blockchain, to deploy smart contracts or run this bytecode on a local instance of the TVM.

### Compile with JS

Using the Blueprint development environment is the most convenient and quickest way to begin developing and compiling smart contracts.
Read more in the [Blueprint](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/getting-started/javascript/) section.

```bash
npm create ton@latest
```

### Use precompiled binaries

If you want to use the FunC compiler locally, you need to set up the TON compiler binaries on your machine.
FunC compiler binaries for Windows, macOS (Intel/Apple Silicon), and Linux can be downloaded from:

- [Precompiled binaries](/v3/documentation/archive/precompiled-binaries/)

:::info
Alternatively, you can build binaries from source code,
such as the [compiler's source code for FunC](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/tree/master/crypto/func/).
Read [how to compile](/v3/guidelines/smart-contracts/howto/compile/compilation-instructions#func) it from source.

such as wallets, electors that manage validation on TON, multi-signature wallets, etc. These can serve as helpful learning references.
