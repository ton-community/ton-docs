## Libraries and helpers from community

- [continuation‑team/openlib.func](https://github.com/continuation-team/openlib.func/) – a set of optimized primitives that reduce transaction fees in common scenarios.
- [open‑contracts/utils](https://github.com/TonoxDeFi/open-contracts/tree/main/contracts/utils/) – general‑purpose utility library for development.
- [open‑contracts/strings](https://github.com/TonoxDeFi/open-contracts/tree/main/contracts/strings/) – provides string manipulation functions.
- [open‑contracts/math](https://github.com/TonoxDeFi/open-contracts/tree/main/contracts/math/) – extends arithmetic operators with additional maths functions.
- [open‑contracts/tuples](https://github.com/TonoxDeFi/open-contracts/tree/main/contracts/tuples/) – a collection of helper functions for working with tuples.
- [open‑contracts/crypto](https://github.com/TonoxDeFi/open-contracts/tree/main/contracts/crypto/) – implements cryptographic operations for secp256k1 curves.
