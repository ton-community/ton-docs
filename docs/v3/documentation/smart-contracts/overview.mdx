# Introduction

Smart contract creation, development, and deployment on TON Blockchain leverage the [TON Virtual Machine (TVM)](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/overview#ton-virtual-machine-tvm) and one of the following programming languages:

- [Tolk](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/tolk/overview) – Next-generation language for developing smart contracts on TON with modern syntax, strong types, and built-in serialization.
- [FunC](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/func/overview) – Minimalist, functional-style language designed for writing low-level TON smart contracts, tightly bound to the TVM model.
- [Fift](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/fift/overview) – Stack-based language for TON, used for deployment, testing, and direct TVM interaction.

## Quick start

If you want to jump right in, follow our [quick start guide](/v3/guidelines/quick-start/developing-smart-contracts/setup-environment).

## Development environment

To build and test smart contracts on TON, it’s best to set up a local development environment. The key components are:

- [Blueprint](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/getting-started/javascript) – an all‑in‑one toolchain for creating, testing and deploying smart contracts.

- [IDE plugins](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/getting-started/ide-plugins) – official TON plugins are available in popular editors such as JetBrains IDEs, Visual Studio Code, and others.

- [Testnet](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/getting-started/testnet) – an test network for development purposes. This network allows you to develop safely and efficiently before moving to Mainnet.


## TON Blockchain course

:::tip
Before starting this course, we recommend taking the [Blockchain Basics with TON](/v3/concepts/educational-resources#blockchain-basics) course, to make sure you have a solid understanding of the basics of blockchain technology.
:::

The course is aimed at developers interested in gaining practical knowledge about the technologies and concepts of the TON blockchain, such as FunC, dApps, decentralization, smart contracts, contract testing, as well as the creation of Mini Apps within Telegram.

## Examples of smart contracts

Examples of smart contracts on TON include wallets, electors (which manage validator elections on TON), and multi-signature wallets, which can serve as references when studying.
