# Introduction

Smart contract creation, development, and deployment on TON Blockchain leverages the [TON Virtual Machine (TVM)](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/overview#ton-virtual-machine-tvm) and one of the following programming languages:

* [Tact](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/overview#-tact)
* [FunC](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/overview#-func)

## Quick start: your first smart contract

Write and deploy your first smart contract with the *Blueprint* framework.

Blueprint is a development environment for writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts.
To create a new demo project, use the following command:

```bash
npm create ton@latest
```

### TON course

:::tip
Before starting the course, make sure you have a solid understanding of the basics of blockchain technology. If you have gaps in your knowledge, we recommend taking the [**Blockchain Basics with TON**](https://stepik.org/course/201294/promo) ([RU version](https://stepik.org/course/202221/), [CHN version](https://stepik.org/course/200976/)) course.
:::

We are proud to present the __TON Blockchain Course__, a comprehensive guide to the TON Blockchain. The course is designed for developers who want to learn how to create smart contracts and decentralized applications on the TON Blockchain.

It consists of __nine modules__ and covers the basics of the TON Blockchain, the smart contract development lifecycle, the FunC programming language, and the TON Virtual Machine (TVM).

## Examples of smart contracts

Explore ready-made smart contract examples and tools provided by the TON community.

:::info little tip
Feel free to focus on smart contracts written in FunC. It is often better to focus on smart contracts written in FunC (.fc) instead of the lower-level Fift (.fif) language.
:::

Standard examples of smart contracts on TON include wallets, electors (which manage validation on TON), and multi-signature wallets, which can serve as references when studying.

### 📒 Tact

Tact is a fresh programming language for TON Blockchain, focused on efficiency and ease of development. It is a good fit for complex smart contracts, quick onboarding and rapid prototyping.

Developed by [TON Studio](https://tonstudio.io), powered by the community — by the end of 2024, the number of _unique code_[^1] contracts deployed on the mainnet reached almost 28 thousand, of which about 33% were written in Tact.

View some of the selected projects: [Tact in production](https://github.com/tact-lang/awesome-tact#tact-in-production-).

[^1]: The "unique code" means that each contract in the data sample has at least one TVM instruction that differs from the other contracts, excluding many preprocessed wallets with everything inlined — even seqno and a public key for signature verification!
