# Smart contract addresses

Every interaction on TON Blockchain occurs between smart contracts, each identified by a unique address. This section explains how these addresses are structured and why they are fundamental to the TON architecture.

## Everything is a smart contract

TON implements the [actor model](/v3/concepts/dive-into-ton/ton-blockchain/overview#single-actor), where all entities, including wallets, are smart contracts. Each actor:

- processes incoming messages
- updates its internal state
- generates outgoing messages

As a result, every actor must have a unique address to ensure the correct message routing.

:::info For Ethereum developers
Unlike the EVM, where addresses and contracts are separate, TON unifies them: every address points to a contract.

## Smart contract address

Smart contract addresses on TON consist of two main components:

- **workchain_id**: the WorkChain ID (signed 32-bit integer).
- **account_id**: the address of the account (64-512 bits, depending on the WorkChain).

### WorkChain ID

TON Blockchain supports up to `2^32` unique WorkChains, each with its own rules. The 32-bit `workchain_id` prefix in smart contract addresses ensures interoperability, allowing contracts to send and receive messages across different WorkChains.

Currently, two WorkChains are active:
- **MasterChain** (`workchain_id = -1`): the central coordinating chain.
- **BaseChain** (`workchain_id = 0`): the default WorkChain for most operations.

Both use **256-bit addresses** for accounts.

### Account ID

All account IDs on TON use 256-bit addresses on the MasterChain and BaseChain (also referred to as the basic WorkChain).

An account ID (**account_id**) is defined as the result of applying a hash function to a smart contract object. Every smart contract operating on TON Blockchain stores two main components:

1. _Compiled code_. The contract logic in bytecode.
2. _Initial data_. The contract's values at the moment it is deployed on-chain.

The contract’s address is derived by calculating the hash of the **(initial code, initial data)** pair:

**account_id = hash(initial code, initial data)**

## Summary

- **Every actor is a smart contract**, each with a unique address for message routing.
- **Address structure**:  
  - `workchain_id` (32-bit): identifies the WorkChain.
  - `account_id` (256-bit): a hash of the contract’s initial code and state.
- **Active WorkChains**: MasterChain and BaseChain, both using 256-bit IDs.
- **Flexibility**: TON supports up to `2^32` WorkChains, allowing future chains to customize address lengths (64–512 bits).
