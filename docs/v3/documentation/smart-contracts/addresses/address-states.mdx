# Address states

This article describes the four possible states of a smart contract address on TON Blockchain.
Understanding these states is crucial for accurately predicting transaction outcomes and ensuring the correct deployment.

## State definitions

Each address exists in one of the following states:

-   **nonexist**: the default state for addresses with no transaction history or those that were deleted. Contains no code, data, or balance. All 2^256 addresses start in this state. An address returns to this initial state when its `storage_fees_due` exceeds 1 TON or when an outgoing message uses flag 32.
-   **uninit**: holds a balance and metadata, but no code or persistent data. An address enters this state when it receives funds. It cannot execute logic but retains funds until the contract code is deployed. An address becomes _uninit_ when a non‑bounce message with a nonzero `value` but without `state_init` is sent to a `nonexist` address.
-   **active**: contains code, data, and a balance. Fully deployed and operational, capable of processing messages. An address becomes `active` when a message with its `state_init` is sent to an `uninit` or `nonexist` address. Note that the hash of `state_init` must match the address for deployment.
-   **frozen**: occurs when `storage_fees_due` 0.1 TON. The account balance becomes zero; unpaid storage fees are tracked as debt (see `StorageInfo.due_payment` and transaction `storage_fees_due`). Only the hashes of the previous code and data cells are preserved. While frozen, the contract cannot execute. To unfreeze, send a message with the valid `state_init` and sufficient funds for storage fees. See the [TON unfreezer](https://unfreezer.ton.org/).

:::note
Thresholds for storage‑fee debt:
- If unpaid storage fees (debt) exceed balance + 0.1 TON, the account becomes frozen ([source](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/72056a2261cbb11f7cf0f20b389bcbffe018b1a8/crypto/block/transaction.cpp#L949C11-L953C12)).
- If the debt exceeds 1 TON, the account is deleted (status `nonexist`) ([source](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/72056a2261cbb11f7cf0f20b389bcbffe018b1a8/crypto/block/transaction.cpp#L936C11-L946C12)).

## State transitions

An address’s state determines how the network handles incoming messages. We present here a diagram that describes all potential changes in the account state during the receipt of internal or external messages.

### Diagram
In the diagram below, there are four nodes representing the four different address states. Each arrow and loop corresponds to a change in the address state at the end of a given transaction. The parameters in the blocks above the arrows (and loops) briefly describe what caused the transaction and also contain some fields that affect the change in the address state.

So, let's look at what changes can occur to a `nonexist` address depending on the messages that come to it.
   - **Receiving external messages**: no changes.
   - **Receiving internal messages**:
      - **With valid `state_init`**: the contract is deployed on its address that becomes `active` before processing the message. If there is no `value` in the message, the computation phase is skipped due to the `cskip_no_gas` reason.
      - **Without `state_init` or with an invalid one**: if the message is **bounceable**, then it returns to the sender, and the address state isn't changed. Otherwise, with no `value` in the message, the address state isn't changed. Finally, with some TONs it becomes `uninit`.

With the diagram **Legend** below, you can inspect all possible changes in the address state when receiving messages with different parameters.

### Legend
 - **type**: message type.
   - any;
   - internal;
   - external;
 - **bounce**: `bounce` flag of an internal message.
   - any;
   - true;
   - false;
 - **value**: an amount of TON in a message.
   - any;
   - 0;
   -  \> 0.
 - **StateInit**: StateInit structure.
   - any;
   - none;
   - invalid: the address computed from a given `state_init` does not match the recipient address;
   - valid: the computed address matches a recipient address;
   - valid last state: must be `state_init` of the last successful transaction before the address change to frozen.
 - **storage_fees_due**: the number of storage fees that were charged but could not be conducted. In the diagram this field indicates `storage_fees_due` after **Storage phase**.
   - < 0.1;
   - [0.1, 1); 
   - < 1;
   - \>= 1.
 - **send_dest_if_zero**: is there any out-going message with flag 32 in the action phase?
   - any;
   - false;
   - true;
   - invalid: there was no **Action phase**.
 - **zero_bal_after_dest_act**: did the account balance become zero when sending some of the messages with flag 32? This field is meaningful only if there's at least one such message during **Action phase**.
   - any;
   - false;
   - true.
 - **action_phase_is_successful**: was **Action phase** successful?
   - false;
   - true.

### Key points

 We additionally review some important points regarding the states except `nonexist`.

**Sending to an `uninit` address**:
   - **Messages of any type without `state_init`**: changes to `nonexist` if its storage_fees_due exceeds 1 TON. Although such a case is really rare, you need to keep this in mind.
   - **Internal message with valid `state_init`**: changes to `active`.

**Sending to `frozen` address**:
   - **Messages of any type**: changes to `nonexist` if its `storage_fees_due` exceeds 1 TON.
   - **Internal message with valid `state_init`**: changes to `active` if its `storage_fees_due` becomes less then 0.1 TON.

**Sending to `active` address**:
   - **Messages of any type**: changes to `nonexist` if its `storage_fees_due` exceeds 1 TON. It also changes to `frozen` if its `storage_fees_due` exceeds 0.1 TON.
   - **Messages of any type**: if in the action list there is an outgoing message with the flag 32 but the action phase was unsuccessful or the balance after this action is positive, the address state doesn't change.
   - **Internal message with any `state_init`**: New `state_init` will be ignored and therefore doesn't change the address state.

**Deployment strategy**: the standard practice for deploying a wallet is to first send a [non-bounceable message](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/message-management/non-bounceable-messages) with Toncoin to its address. This transitions the address to the `uninit` state. The wallet owner can then deploy the contract in a subsequent transaction, using the pre-funded balance.

**Protection against errors**: standard wallets and applications manage these complexities by automatically setting the `bounce` flag based on the state of the destination address. Developers of custom applications must implement similar logic to prevent fund loss.

## Summary

- The address state (`nonexist`, `uninit`, `active`, `frozen`) defines behavior.
- Correct handling of `state_init` and the `bounce` flag is crucial for successful deployment and avoiding unintended fund transfers.
- There are many cases when the address state can become `nonexist` or `frozen`. Keep track of the amount of TON on the account balance!  
- Each new `state_init` is ignored when the address state is active.
