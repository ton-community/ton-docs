# Forward fees

This page explains how smart contracts handle message forwarding fees and value transfers between contracts.

## Overview

When a smart contract sends a query to another smart contract, it must pay for:
- Sending the internal message (message forwarding fees)
- Processing the message (gas fees)
- Sending back the answer, if required (message forwarding fees)

## Standard message handling

:::note
In most cases, the sender:
1. Attaches enough Toncoin to cover gas and forwarding fees to the internal message
2. Sets the `bounce` flag (sends a bounceable internal message)

The receiver then returns the unused portion of the received value with the answer, deducting message forwarding fees.
In Jettons it is typically done using `RAWRESERVE` with `SENDRAWMSG` + [`mode = 128/130/144`](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/message-management/message-modes-cookbook#mode128).

## Message bouncing

### Automatic bouncing

If the receiver cannot parse the received message and terminates with a non-zero exit code (for example, due to an unhandled cell deserialization exception), the message automatically bounces back to its sender. The bounced message:
- Has its `bounce` flag cleared
- Has its `bounced` flag set
- Contains `0xffffffff` (32-bit) followed by the original message body (256-bit)

### Handling bounced messages

Always check the `bounced` flag of incoming internal messages before parsing the `op` field. This prevents processing a bounced message as a new query.

If the `bounced` flag is set:
- You can identify the failed query by deserializing `op` and `query_id`
- Take appropriate action based on the failure
- Alternatively, terminate with zero exit code to ignore bounced messages

:::note
The `bounced` flag is set by the protocol during bounce; a message with this flag indicates a bounced message. See also: [non-bounceable messages](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/message-management/non-bounceable-messages).

## Error handling

If the receiver successfully parses the incoming query but:
- The requested method `op` is not supported
- Another error condition is met

Send a response with `op` equal to `0xffffffff` or another appropriate value using `SENDRAWMSG` with `mode = 64`.

## Value transfer with confirmation

Some operations require both value transfer and confirmation. For example, the validator elections smart contract receives:
- An election participation request
- The stake as the attached value

### Implementation

1. The sender should attach an additional amount of Toncoin sufficient to cover fees (in addition to the main transfer value, e.g., the stake)
2. If an error occurs (e.g., stake not accepted):
   - Return the full received amount minus processing and forwarding fees
   - Include an error message using `SENDRAWMSG` with `mode = 64`
3. On success:
   - Create a confirmation message
   - Return exactly one Toncoin (fees paid from balance)
   - Use `SENDRAWMSG` with `mode = 1`
