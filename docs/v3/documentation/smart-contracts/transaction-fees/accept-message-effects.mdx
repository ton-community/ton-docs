# Accept message effects

The `accept_message` and `set_gas_limit` TVM primitives play a crucial role in managing gas limits and transaction processing in TON smart contracts. While their basic functionality is documented in the [stdlib reference](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/func/docs/stdlib#accept_message), their effects on transaction processing, gas limits, and contract balances can be complex and have important security implications. This page explores these effects in detail, particularly focusing on how they impact external and internal message processing.

## External messages

External messages follow this processing flow:

- The `gas_limit` is initially set to `gas_credit` [Param 20 and 21](/v3/documentation/network/config-params/overview#param-20-and-21), which equals 10,000 gas units.
- During the Compute phase, a contract must call `accept_message` or `set_gas_limit` to raise the gas limit and indicate its readiness to pay processing fees.
- If `gas_credit` is depleted or computation completes without `accept_message`, the external message is not included in a block and no transaction is created.
- Gas limit semantics:
  - `accept_message` sets `gl` to the maximum allowed (`gm`).
  - `set_gas_limit(limit)` sets `gl` to `min(limit, gm)`.
  - `gm` is capped by the network gas limit (Config Param 20 and 21).

- After transaction completion, full computation fees are deducted from the contract balance (making `gas_credit` truly a credit, not free gas).

If an error occurs after `accept_message` (in either Compute or Action phase):
- The transaction is recorded on the blockchain.
- Fees are deducted from the contract balance.
- Storage remains unchanged unless state was committed with `commit()` prior to the error.
- Actions are not applied.

Note on action errors and flags:
- By default, a compute/action failure reverts state and cancels pending actions.
- With `ignore_errors` (send mode flag `2`), failed sends are skipped without reverting other actions.
- For action-phase errors, a bounce occurs only if the failed send used flag `16` (bounce on action error).

**Critical security consideration**

If a contract accepts an external message and then throws an exception (due to invalid message data or serialization errors), it:
- Pays for processing.
- Cannot prevent message replay.
- Will continue accepting the same message until its balance is depleted.

## Internal messages

When a contract receives an internal message from another contract:
- Default gas limit: `message_value`/`gas_price` (message covers its own processing).
- The contract can modify this limit using `accept_message`/`set_gas_limit`.

Note that manual settings of gas limits do not interfere with bouncing behavior; messages will be bounced if sent in bounceable mode and contain enough money to pay for their processing and the creation of bounce messages.

:::info Example
**Case 1:**
If you send a bounceable message with 0.1 TON in the BaseChain that is accepted by a contract with a 1 TON balance, and the computation costs 0.005 TON, with forwarding fees of 0.001 TON, then the bounce message will contain `0.1 - 0.005 - 0.001` = `0.094` TON.

**Case 2:**
If in the same example, the computation cost is 0.5 TON (instead of 0.005 TON), there will be no bounce (the message balance would be `0.1 - 0.5 - 0.001 = -0.401`, thus no bounce), and the contract balance will be `1 + 0.1 - 0.5` = `0.6` TON.
