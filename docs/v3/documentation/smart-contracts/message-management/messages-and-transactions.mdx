# Messages and transactions

TON is an asynchronous blockchain with a complex structure that is very different from other blockchains. Because of this, new developers often have questions about low-level things in TON. In this article, we will examine one such question related to message delivery.

## What is a message?

A message is a set of instructions intended for a single actor. In TON Blockchain, it serves as the fundamental unit of interaction between accounts. All logic execution, state changes, and contract-to-contract communication are initiated by messages.

      dark: "/img/docs/message-delivery/message_delivery_1_dark.png?raw=true",
    }}
  />
</div>
<br />

Working with this type of communication is reminiscent of launching a satellite into space. While we know the message we've created, observation after launch is required to determine the outcome.

## What is a transaction?

A transaction in TON is a **record** of an account's state update caused by processing an incoming message. It consists of:

- the **incoming message** that triggered the contract
- the **state changes** performed by the contract during message processing (e.g., storage or balance updates)
- any **outgoing messages** sent to other contracts (if applicable)

> Technically, a contract can be triggered through special functions such as [Tick-tock](/v3/documentation/data-formats/layout/transactions#tick-tock). Still, this function is more used for internal TON Blockchain core contracts.

> Not every transaction results in outgoing messages or updates to the contract's storage - this depends on the actions defined by the contract's code.

  }}

<br />

If we look at Ethereum or almost any other synchronous blockchain, each transaction can contain several smart contract calls. For example, DEXs perform multiple exchanges in one transaction if there is no liquidity for the selected trading pair.

In an asynchronous system, you can't get a response from the destination smart contract in the same transaction. Depending on the length of the route between source and destination, a contract call may take a few blocks to process.

Achieving the Infinity Sharding Paradigm (ISP) requires full parallelization, ensuring that each transaction executes independently of others. Therefore, instead of transactions that affect and change the state of many contracts simultaneously, each transaction in TON is only executed on a single smart contract, and smart contracts communicate through messages. That way, smart contracts can only interact with each other by calling their functions with special messages and getting a response to them via other messages later.

### Transaction outcome

The successful outcome of a transaction is determined by the successful completion of all its phases:

- No phases were skipped during execution.
- **Compute phase** — the smart contract finished with [exit code](/v3/documentation/tvm/exit-codes) `0` or `1`.
- **Action phase** — all actions were created and applied correctly with result code `0`.

If the [compute phase is skipped](/v3/documentation/tvm/overview#when-the-compute-phase-is-skipped), for example, due to insufficient funds or an invalid account state, the transaction is considered unsuccessful.

For more details, see [transaction success criteria](/v3/guidelines/dapps/transactions/explore-transactions#transaction-success-criteria).

## What is a logical time?

In a system with asynchronous and parallel smart contract calls, it can be hard to define the order of actions to process. That's why each message in TON has its _Logical time_ or _Lamport time_ (later just _lt_). This time is used to understand which event caused another and what a validator needs to process first.

It is strictly guaranteed that the transaction resulting from a message will have a _lt_ greater than the _lt_ of the message. Likewise, the _lt_ of a message sent in some transaction is strictly greater than the _lt_ of the transaction that caused it. In addition, messages sent from one account and transactions on one account are strictly ordered.

<br />

    dark: "/img/docs/message-delivery/message_delivery_3_dark.png?raw=true",
  }}
/>
<br />

For the case in the image, it turns out: `in_msg_lt < tx0_lt < out_msg_lt`

Thanks to this, we always know the order of transactions, received messages and sent messages for every account.

Moreover, if account _A_ sends two messages to account _B_, it is guaranteed that the message with a lower _lt_ will be processed earlier:

If `msg1_lt < msg2_lt` => `tx1_lt < tx2_lt`.

<br />
<div class="text--center">
  <ThemedImage
    alt="Message order guarantee"
    sources={{
      light: "/img/docs/message-delivery/message_delivery_5.png?raw=true",
      dark: "/img/docs/message-delivery/message_delivery_5_dark.png?raw=true",
    }}
  />
</div>
<br />

Otherwise, an attempt to synchronize delivery would require knowing the state of all other shards before processing one shard, thereby breaking parallelization and destroying efficient sharding.

For each block, we can define the _lt_ span as starting from the first transaction and ending with the _lt_ of the last event in the block (message or transaction). Blocks are ordered like other events in TON, so if one block depends on the other, it has a higher _lt_. The child block in a shard has a higher _lt_ than its parent. A MasterChain block's _lt_ is higher than the _lts_ of shard blocks that it lists since a master block depends on listed shard blocks. Each shard block contains an ordered reference to the latest (at the moment of shard block creation) master block, and thus, the shard block _lt_ is higher than the referenced master block _lt_.

## Message delivery

TON guarantees that all internal messages are reliably delivered to their destination account and cannot be lost in transit.
Validators control external messages' initial acceptance into blocks. However, once an external message enters the incoming message queue, it receives the same delivery guarantee as internal messages.


### Delivery order

Therefore, it seems like _lt_ solves the issue of message delivery order because we know that a transaction with a lower _lt_ will be processed first. But this doesn't work in every scenario.

Suppose there are two contracts - _A_ and _B_. _A_ receives an external message, which triggers it to send two internal messages to _B_. Let's call these messages _1_ and _2_. In this simple case, we can be 100% sure that _1_ will be processed by _B_ before _2_ because it has a lower _lt_.

<br />
<div class="text--center">
  <ThemedImage
    alt="Simple message order"
    sources={{
      light: "/img/docs/message-delivery/msg-delivery-1.png?raw=true",
      dark: "/img/docs/message-delivery/msg-delivery-1-dark.png?raw=true",
    }}
  />
</div>
<br />

But this is just a simple case when we have only two contracts. How does our system work in more complex cases?

### Several smart contracts

Consider three contracts - _A_, _B_, and _C_. When contract _A_ sends two internal messages (_1_ to _B_ and _2_ to _C_) in a single transaction, the messages are created in strict order (_1_ first, then _2_). However, their processing order at the destinations isn't guaranteed because:

1. **Network paths may differ**: The routes to _B_ and _C_ might involve different validator sets
2. **Shard chain effects**: If _B_ and _C_ are in separate shard chains, messages may traverse different numbers of blocks
3. **Asynchronous processing**: Each shard chain progresses independently, potentially causing delivery timing variations

While the sending order is preserved at the source, TON's decentralized sharded architecture means the receiving order can't be predetermined.

For better clarity, suppose our contracts send back messages `msg1'` and `msg2'` after `msg1` and `msg2` are executed by contracts `B` and `C`. As a result, contract `A` will apply transactions `tx2'` and `tx1'`.
We have two possible traces for these transactions:

1. The first possible order is `tx1'_lt < tx2'_lt`:

<br />
<div class="text--center">
  <ThemedImage
    alt="Complex message order 1"
    sources={{
      light: "/img/docs/message-delivery/message_delivery_6.png?raw=true",
      dark: "/img/docs/message-delivery/message_delivery_6_dark.png?raw=true",
    }}
  />
</div>
<br />

2. The second possible order is `tx2'_lt < tx1'_lt`:

<br />
<div class="text--center">
  <ThemedImage
    alt="Complex message order 2"
    sources={{
      light: "/img/docs/message-delivery/message_delivery_7.png?raw=true",
      dark: "/img/docs/message-delivery/message_delivery_7_dark.png?raw=true",
    }}
  />
</div>
<br />

The same happens in the reverse case, when two contracts, _B_ and _C_, send a message to one contract, _A_. Even if message `B -> A` was sent before `C -> A`, we can't know which one will be delivered first. The `B -> A` route may require more shard chain hops.

<br />
<div class="text--center">
  <ThemedImage
    alt="Reverse message flow"
    sources={{
      light: "/img/docs/message-delivery/msg-delivery-3.png?raw=true",
      dark: "/img/docs/message-delivery/msg-delivery-3_dark.png?raw=true",
    }}
  />
</div>
<br />

There can be many scenarios of smart contract interactions, and in any scenario with more than 2 contracts, the order of message delivery may be arbitrary. The only guarantee is that messages from contract _A_ to contract _B_ will be processed in order of their logical time. Some examples are below.

<br />
<div class="text--center">
  <ThemedImage
    alt="Multi-contract scenario 1"

      light: "/img/docs/message-delivery/msg-delivery-4.png?raw=true",
      dark: "/img/docs/message-delivery/msg-delivery-4_dark.png?raw=true",
    }}
  />
</div>
<br />

<br />
<div class="text--center">
  <ThemedImage
    alt="Multi-contract scenario 2"
    sources={{
      light: "/img/docs/message-delivery/msg-delivery-5.png?raw=true",
      dark: "/img/docs/message-delivery/msg-delivery-5_dark.png?raw=true",
    }}
  />
</div>
<br />

<br />
<div class="text--center">
  <ThemedImage
    alt="Multi-contract scenario 3"
    sources={{
      light: "/img/docs/message-delivery/msg-delivery-6.png?raw=true",
      dark: "/img/docs/message-delivery/msg-delivery-6-dark.png?raw=true",
    }}
  />
</div>
<br />

## Conclusion

The TON blockchain's asynchronous structure creates challenges for message delivery guarantees. Logical time helps to establish event and transaction order but doesn't guarantee message delivery order between multiple smart contracts due to varying routes in shard chains. Despite these complexities, TON ensures internal message delivery, maintaining network reliability. Developers must adapt to these nuances to harness TON's full potential in building innovative decentralized applications.
