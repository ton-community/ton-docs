# External messages

**External message** in TON is a message that originates *outside the blockchain* or is intended for actors *outside it*. These messages enable interaction between smart contracts and the external world. External messages come in two types:

- External incoming messages
- External outgoing messages

## External incoming messages

**External incoming messages (external inbound, ext_in)** are messages sent from outside to smart contracts on TON Blockchain. They serve as the main entry point for external actors to interact with the blockchain.

**Key points**
- Any account can receive external incoming messages, but handling depends on the contract’s logic.
- Common sources include wallet users, validators, and DApp services.
- Wallet contracts often receive external incoming messages and relay instructions internally through _internal messages_.

### External incoming message structure

All messages in TON commonly defined with the following structure: 

```tlb
message$_ {X:Type} info:CommonMsgInfo
init:(Maybe (Either StateInit ^StateInit))
body:(Either X ^X) = Message X;
```

- `info: CommonMsgInfo` — contains metadata about the message.
- `init: (Maybe (Either StateInit ^StateInit))` — optional field used to initialize a new account or update the existing one.
- `body: (Either X ^X)` —  the main payload of the message; can be embedded directly or stored as a reference.

An **external incoming message** is a message whose `CommonMsgInfo` header organized as the `ext_in_msg_info$10` structure.

```tlb
//external incoming message
ext_in_msg_info$10 src:MsgAddressExt dest:MsgAddressInt
import_fee:Grams = CommonMsgInfo;
```

| Structure          | Type                                 | Required | Description                                                                                                                     |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ext_in_msg_info$10 | Constructor                          | Required | The `$10` tag indicates that the `CommonMsgInfo` begins with `10` bits in serialization, denoting an external incoming message. |
| src                | [MsgAddressExt](#msgaddressext-tl-b) | Required | The external sender’s address.                                                                                                  |
| dest               | [MsgAddressInt](#msgaddressint-tl-b) | Required | The destination smart contract address.                                                                                         |
| import_fee         | [VarUInteger 16](#varuinteger-n)     | Required | The fee for executing and delivering the message.                                                                               |


The sender is always an **external actor**— either a wallet or custom code interacting through blockchain APIs.


## External outgoing messages

**External outgoing messages (external-out)** are messages sent _from a smart contract to an off-chain actor `(MsgAddressExt)`_. Unlike internal or incoming messages, they do **not** have a specific recipient within the blockchain.

**Key points**
- Used to communicate with external systems, e.g., as callbacks or signals.
- Typically important for tasks such as:
  - Indexing and monitoring blockchain state,
  - Triggering off-chain processes like notifying external services or updating UIs.


### External outgoing message structure

All messages in TON commonly defined with the following structure:

```tlb
message$_ {X:Type} info:CommonMsgInfo
init:(Maybe (Either StateInit ^StateInit))
body:(Either X ^X) = Message X;
```

- `info: CommonMsgInfo` — contains metadata about the message.
- `init: (Maybe (Either StateInit ^StateInit))` — optional field used to initialize a new account or update the existing one.
- `body: (Either X ^X)` —  the main payload of the message; can be embedded directly or stored as a reference.

An **external outgoing message** is a message whose `CommonMsgInfo` header organized as the `ext_out_msg_info$11`

```tlb
//external outgoing message
ext_out_msg_info$11 src:MsgAddressInt dest:MsgAddressExt
created_lt:uint64 created_at:uint32 = CommonMsgInfo;
```


| Structure           | Type                                 | Required | Description                                                                                                                     |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ext_out_msg_info$11 | Constructor                          | Required | The `$11` tag indicates that the `CommonMsgInfo` begins with `11` bits in serialization, denoting an external outgoing message. |
| src                 | [MsgAddressInt](#msgaddressint-tl-b) | Required | The sender’s smart contract address.                                                                                            |
| dest                | [MsgAddressExt](#msgaddressext-tl-b) | Required | The external destination address for the message.                                                                               |
| created_lt          | uint64                               | Required | Logic times of the message, assigned by the validator. Used for ordering actions in the smart contract.                         |
| created_at          | uint32                               | Required | UNIX timestamp representing when the message was created.                                                                       |


## Replay protection

:::caution
Ensure replay protection in contracts that process external inbound (ext_in) messages.
:::

Notice that all external messages must be protected against replay attacks. The validators normally remove an external message from the pool of suggested external messages (received from the network); however, in some situations a validator could process the same external message twice, resulting in a duplicate transaction. Even worse, a malicious actor could extract the external message from the block containing the processing transaction and resend it later. This could force a wallet smart contract to repeat a payment.

The simplest way to protect smart contracts from replay attacks related to external messages is to store a 32-bit counter `seqno` in the persistent data of the smart contract, and to expect a `msg-seqno` value in (the signed part of) any inbound external messages. Then an external message is accepted only if both the signature is valid and `msg-seqno` equals `seqno`. After successful processing, the `seqno` value in the persistent data is increased by one, so the same external message will never be accepted again.

Include a `valid-until` field (32-bit Unix time) in the external message and accept it only if the current Unix time is less than `valid-until`; this can be used together with the `seqno` mechanism. Alternatively, the receiving smart contract could store the set of (the hashes of) all recent (not expired) accepted external messages in its persistent data and reject a new external message if it is a duplicate of one of the stored messages. Some garbage collection of expired messages in this set should also be performed to avoid bloating the persistent data. See also: [Wallet v2 spec](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/contracts-specs/wallet-contracts#wallet-v2), [Wallet replay protection](/v3/guidelines/smart-contracts/howto/wallet#replay-protection).

:::note
In general, an external message begins with a 512-bit Ed25519 signature (if needed), a 32-bit `msg-seqno` (if needed), a 32-bit `valid-until` (if needed), and possibly a 32-bit `op` and other required parameters depending on `op`. The layout of external messages does not need to be as standardized as that of internal messages because external messages are not used for interaction between different smart contracts (written by different developers and managed by different owners).
