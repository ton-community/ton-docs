# Message modes cookbook

Understanding the modes and flags available for sending messages is crucial to ensure your smart contracts behave as intended.
This section will illustrate their practical application through specific examples.

:::info IMPORTANT
You can check [this example](https://testnet.tonviewer.com/transaction/42ed45726e4fe994b7fd6dbf953a2ac24ecd77753858abeda9d6755c664a537a) as a real‐world validation.

#### Message value and account balance

Please check how [get_balance](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/func/docs/stdlib/#get_balance) works to better understand `balance` inside TVM.

All TON tokens held by a contract are reflected in the contract `balance`. Some of these tokens are also assigned to the currently processed incoming `message`. This mechanism is effective because any TON transaction involving a [non‐system contract](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/contracts-specs/governance) processes exactly one incoming message at a time.

Therefore, any blockchain payment may come either:

- From the incoming message's `value`.
  Contracts pay computation fees this way unless they call [accept_message](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/transaction-fees/accept-message-effects), which prevents malicious actors from spending the contract's balance to process their data
- From the contract's `balance`, which leaves the incoming TON amount untouched during the transaction
  This approach currently applies to storage fees in workchains 0 and -1, along with most common actions

#### Fees

Actual transaction fees will vary depending on the blockchain configuration, the smart contract code, and other factors. When a message is received, part of the contract `balance` will be consumed by storage and gas fees if the message `value` [is above a certain amount](/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-overview#compute-phase-skipped).

According to the [transaction flow](/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-overview#transactions-and-phases), there are five distinct phases:

1. **Storage**: This phase includes both account storage and in_msg import.
2. **Credit**: In this phase, the `value` of `in_msg` [is added](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/7151ff26279fef6dcfa1f47fc0c5b63677ae2458/crypto/block/transaction.cpp#L959-L981) to the `balance`.
3. **Compute**: The TVM executes the smart contract code.
4. **Action**: This phase involves performing actions such as `SENDRAWMSG`.
5. **Bounce**: This phase manages everything related to bouncing.

The order is: storage_fee -> import_fee -> gas_fee -> action_fee + fwd_fee

:::info IMPORTANT
The table is populated based on [this example](https://tonviewer.com/transaction/b5e14a9c4a4e982fda42d6079c3f84fa48e76497a8f3fca872f9a3737f1f6262). You can check the [**live calculator**](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/transaction-fees/fees#basic-fees-formula).

Funds included with an ignored message will still be [credited to the receiving address](https://testnet.tonviewer.com/transaction/8a388731812c80ab9b0ea9531108425488af5def854e4bd6f0ed47362b56d557).

If no errors occur, the result is the same as [mode = 0](#mode0).

The key difference is that `flag 16` creates bounces for [action phase errors](/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-exit-codes#standard-exit-codes). In contrast, the message's [built‐in bounce flag](https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/smart-contracts/howto/wallet#internal-message-creation) handles protocol‐level failures like:

- The destination contract does not exist.
- The destination contract throws an unhandled exception.
