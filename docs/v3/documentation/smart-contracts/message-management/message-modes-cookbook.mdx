# Message Modes Cookbook

:::danger Caution

:::

Understanding the different modes and flags available for sending messages is important to ensure that your smart contracts behave correctly. 
While [message modes](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/message-management/sending-messages#message-modes) section provided detailed descriptions of these modes and flags, in this section we will illustrate their practical application with specific examples.

#### Message value and account balance
There are 2 ways to pay for blockchain action: 
* from [message value](/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/msg-tlb#commonmsginfo). 
* from [contract balance](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/7151ff26279fef6dcfa1f47fc0c5b63677ae2458/crypto/block/block.tlb#L263C1-L265C20)

Typically it's charged from contract `balance`, but in specific cases it will use part of the message `value`. The transaction fees used in these examples are hypothetical and are used for illustrative purposes only, any fees other than message forward are out of scope of this article.

:::info IMPORTANT
__Note__: Actual transaction fees will vary depending on blockchain configuration, code of the smart contract and other factors. When message is received, part of it will be consumed for gas and storage fees. Please check how [get_balance](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/func/docs/stdlib/#get_balance) works to understand transaction state better. You can check [this example](https://testnet.tonviewer.com/transaction/42ed45726e4fe994b7fd6dbf953a2ac24ecd77753858abeda9d6755c664a537a) as a real-world confirmation.

## 1. Send a regular message

State before transaction: Account A has 1 TON, Account B has 1 TON

__A__ sent 0.1 TON to __B__, [msg_fwd_fees](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/transaction-fees/fees-low-level#forward-fees) are 0.004 TON, actual received value will be 0.096 TON, `fwd_fee` and `action_fee` deducted from `value`.

State after transaction: Account A has 0.9 TON, Account B has 1.096 TON

![](/img/docs/message-modes-cookbook/send_regular_message.svg)

| Mode and Flags | Code |
|:-|:-|
| `mode` = 0, no `flag` | `send_raw_message(msg, 0)` |

## 2. Send a regular message, no bounce the message on error and ignore it

State before transaction: Account A has 1 TON, Account B has 1 TON

__A__ sent 0.1 TON to __B__, `msg_fwd_fees` are 0.004 TON, actual received value will be 0.096 TON, `fwd_fee` and `action_fee` deducted from `value`.
In case of an error during transaction processing, the message will not bounce and will be ignored.

State after transaction: Account A has 0.9 TON, Account B has 1.096 TON

:::info tip
Funds included with an ignored message will still be [credited to the receiving address](https://testnet.tonviewer.com/transaction/8a388731812c80ab9b0ea9531108425488af5def854e4bd6f0ed47362b56d557). 
If no errors the result is the same as [`mode = 0`](#1-send-a-regular-message).

| Mode and Flags | Code |
|:-|:-|
| `mode` = 0, `flag` = 2 | `send_raw_message(msg, 2)` |

## 3. Send a regular message and bounce the message on action error

State before transaction: Account A has 1 TON, Account B has 1 TON

__A__ sent 0.1 TON to __B__, `msg_fwd_fees` are 0.004 TON, actual received value will be 0.096 TON, `fwd_fee` and `action_fee` deducted from `value`.
In case of an error during [action phase](https://retracer.ton.org/?tx=e9dccba82badc0d742f14eff41c203280f380e87180b5314fcfd742856e598f7&testnet=true), the message will bounce and `total_fee` + `fwd_fee` will be deducted from `value`.

State after transaction with error: Account A has 1 - ([total_fee](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/transaction-fees/fees#basic-fees-formula) + `fwd_fee`) TON, Account B has 1 TON

:::info tip
If no errors the result is the same as [`mode = 0`](#1-send-a-regular-message).
