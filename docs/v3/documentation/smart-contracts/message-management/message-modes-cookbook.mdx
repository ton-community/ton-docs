# Message modes cookbook

Understanding the modes and flags for sending messages ensures your smart contracts behave as intended. This section illustrates their practical application through specific examples.

:::info IMPORTANT
You can check [this example](https://testnet.tonviewer.com/transaction/42ed45726e4fe994b7fd6dbf953a2ac24ecd77753858abeda9d6755c664a537a) as a real-world validation.
:::

#### Message value and account balance

The contract reflects all TON tokens it holds in its `balance`. Some of these tokens are also assigned to the currently processed incoming `message`. This mechanism is effective because any TON transaction involving a [non-system contract](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/contracts-specs/governance) processes exactly one incoming message at a time.

> To better understand the `balance` inside the TVM, refer to how the [get_balance](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/func/docs/stdlib/#get_balance) function operates.

Therefore, any blockchain payment may come either:

- From the incoming message's `value`.
  Contracts pay computation fees this way unless they call [accept_message](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/transaction-fees/accept-message-effects), which prevents malicious actors from spending the contract's balance to process their data
- From the contract's `balance`, which leaves the incoming TON amount untouched during the transaction
  This approach currently applies to storage fees in workchains 0 and -1 and for the most common actions

#### Fees

Actual transaction fees will vary depending on the blockchain configuration, the smart contract code, and other factors. When a message is received, storage and gas fees will consume part of the contract `balance` if the message `value` [is above a certain amount](/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-overview#compute-phase-skipped).

According to the [transaction flow](/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-overview#transactions-and-phases), each transaction consists of five distinct phases:

- **Storage phase**  
   Handles storage fee and `in_msg` import fee.

- **Credit phase**  
   The `in_msg` value [is credited](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/7151ff26279fef6dcfa1f47fc0c5b63677ae2458/crypto/block/transaction.cpp#L959-L981) to the account balance.

- **Compute phase**  
   Executes the smart contract code via TVM.

- **Action phase**  
   Processes transaction outputs including `SENDRAWMSG` operations.

- **Bounce phase**  
   Manages message bounce handling when applicable.

#### Execution order notes:

For non-bounceable messages:
Credit → Storage → Compute → Action → Bounce

For bounceable messages:
Storage → Credit → Compute → Action → Bounce

> Compute, Action and Bounce phases may be skipped

#### Fee deduction sequence

1. Storage fees
2. Message import fees
3. Computation gas fees
4. Action processing fees + forward fees

The table is populated using [this example transaction](https://tonviewer.com/transaction/b5e14a9c4a4e982fda42d6079c3f84fa48e76497a8f3fca872f9a3737f1f6262).

The transaction fees used in these examples are hypothetical and for illustrative purposes only. Any fees other than message forwarding are outside the scope of this article.
Funds included with an ignored message will still be [credited to the receiving address](https://testnet.tonviewer.com/transaction/8a388731812c80ab9b0ea9531108425488af5def854e4bd6f0ed47362b56d557).

In case of an error during [action phase](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/message-management/sending-messages#message-modes), the message will be skipped instead of throwing an [exit code](/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-exit-codes#standard-exit-codes).

State after the transaction: Account A has 0.9 TON, Account B has 1.096 TON

If no errors occur, the result is the same as [mode = 0](#mode0).

:::info tip
If no errors occur, the result is the same as [mode = 0](#mode0).

The key difference is that `flag 16` creates bounces for [action phase errors](/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-exit-codes#standard-exit-codes). In contrast, the message's [built‐in bounce flag](https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/smart-contracts/howto/wallet#internal-message-creation) handles protocol‐level failures like:

- The destination contract does not exist.
- The destination contract throws an unhandled exception.
