# Environment setup

To start working with Tolk, you need a development environment.

We recommend using **Blueprint**, a tool for writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts on TON.

## Create a new TON project

> **Prerequisite:** Node.js v16 or higher

1. Create a new TON project:
   ```bash
   npm create ton@latest
   ```
2. Enter any project name and select **"A simple counter contract (Tolk)"** when prompted by Blueprint.

## Project structure

Here's a quick look at the typical project layout:

   ```
   my-first-contract/
   ├── build/             # Compiled smart contract bytecode
   ├── contracts/         # Smart contract sources (e.g., counter.tolk)
   ├── scripts/           # TypeScript deployment scripts
   ├── tests/             # TypeScript tests
   ├── wrappers/          # TypeScript wrappers for contracts
   ```

## Build the project

```bash
npx blueprint build
# or
yarn blueprint build
```
Blueprint compiles the contract and displays the resulting bytecode, along with its hash. The output is saved in the `build/` directory.

## Run tests

```bash
npx blueprint test
# or
yarn blueprint test
```
This runs unit tests from the `tests/` directory.

## Deploy or run a script

```bash
npx blueprint run
# or
yarn blueprint run
```
Use this command to deploy your contract to Mainnet, Testnet, or MyLocalTon.

## IDE support

Tolk is supported in IntelliJ-based IDEs using the [TON plugin](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/intellij-ton) and in Visual Studio Code through the [TON extension](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton-language-server).
