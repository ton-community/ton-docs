# Setting up the environment

To start working with Tolk, you’ll need a development environment. 

We recommend using **Blueprint**, a tool for writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts on TON.


## Create a new TON project

*(Node.js version 16 or higher required)*

1. Create a new TON project:
   ```bash
   npm create ton@latest
   ```

2. Enter any project name and select **"A simple counter contract (Tolk)"** when prompted by Blueprint.

## Project structure:
   ```
   my-first-contract/
   ├── build/             # Compiled smart contract bytecode
   ├── contracts/         # Smart contract sources (e.g., counter.tolk)
   ├── scripts/           # TypeScript deployment scripts
   ├── tests/             # TypeScript tests
   ├── wrappers/          # TypeScript wrappers for contracts
   ```

## Build

`npx blueprint build` or `yarn blueprint build`

The result (smart contract(s) bytecode and its hash) will be displayed in the console and saved in `build/` directory.

## Test

`npx blueprint test` or `yarn blueprint test`

Run unit tests from the `test/` folder.

## Deploy or run script

`npx blueprint run` or `yarn blueprint run`

This way, you can deploy your smart contract to the mainnet, testnet, or MyLocalTon.

## IDE Support

Tolk is supported by the IntelliJ IDEs and VS Code with "TON" extension.
