# History of Tolk

When new versions of Tolk are released, they will be mentioned here.


## v0.6

The first public release. Here are some notes about its origin: 


## How Tolk was born

In June 2024, I created a pull request [FunC v0.5.0](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/pull/1026).
Besides this PR, I've written a roadmap â€” what can be enhanced in FunC, syntactically and semantically.

All in all, instead of merging v0.5.0 and continuing developing FunC, we decided to **fork** it.
To leave FunC untouched, as it is. As it always was. And to develop a new language, driven by a fresh and new name.

For several months, I have worked on Tolk privately. I have implemented a giant list of changes.
And it's not only about the syntax. For instance, Tolk has an internal AST representation, completely missed in FunC.

On TON Gateway, on 1-2 November in Dubai, I had a speech presenting Tolk to the public, and we released it the same day.
Once the video is available, I'll attach it here.

Here is the very first pull request: ["Tolk Language: next-generation FunC"](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/pull/1345).

The first version of the Tolk Language is v0.6, a metaphor of FunC v0.5 that missed a chance to occur.


## Meaning of the name "Tolk"

I'll update this section after announcing Tolk on TON Gateway.
