# History of Tolk

Once new versions are released, they will be announced on this page.

## v1.0

1. The magic `lazy` keyword — lazy loading, partial loading, partial updating
2. Auto-detect and inline functions at the compiler level
3. Various peephole optimizations for gas efficiency
4. `onInternalMessage` and `onBouncedMessage`, TVM‑11 support (new instructions; see [Tolk vs FunC: in detail](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/tolk/tolk-vs-func/in-detail))
5. Custom pack/unpack serializers for custom types


## v0.99

1. Universal `createMessage`
2. Universal `createExternalLogMessage`
3. Sharding — calculate addresses 'close to' another contract.


## v0.13

1. Auto-packing to/from cells/builders/slices
2. Type `address`
3. `lateinit` variables
4. Defaults for parameters


## v0.12

1. Structures `struct A { ... }`
2. Generics `struct<T>`
3. Methods `fun Point.getX(self)`
4. Rename stdlib functions to short methods


## v0.11

1. Type aliases `type NewName = <existing type>`
2. Union types `T1 | T2 | ...`
3. Pattern matching for types
4. Operators `is` and `!is`
5. Pattern matching for expressions
6. Semicolon for the last statement in a block can be omitted


## v0.10

1. Fixed-width integers: `int32`, `uint64`, etc. [Details](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/pull/1559)
2. Type `coins` and function `ton("0.05")`
3. `bytesN` and `bitsN` types (backed by slices at the TVM level)
4. Replace `"..."c` postfixes with `stringCrc32("...")` functions
5. Support `0b...` number literals along with `0x...`
6. Trailing comma support


## v0.9

1. Nullable types `int?`, `cell?`, etc.; null safety
2. Standard library (asm definitions) updated to reflect nullability
3. Smart casts, like in TypeScript in Kotlin
4. Operator `!` (non-null assertion)
5. Code after `throw` is treated as unreachable
6. The `never` type


## v0.8

1. Syntax `tensorVar.0` and `tupleVar.0` (both for reading and writing)
2. Allow `cell`, `slice`, etc. to be valid identifiers (not keywords)


## v0.7

1. Under the hood: refactor compiler internals; AST-level semantic analysis kernel
2. Under the hood: rewrite the type system from Hindley-Milner to static typing
3. Clear and readable error messages on type mismatch
4. Generic functions `fun f<T>(...)` and instantiations like `f<int>(...)`
5. The `bool` type; type casting via `value as T`


## v0.6

The first public release.


## A brief history of Tolk

When Tolk was first conceived, the idea was simple:
What if we had a language for TON that was **low-level and efficient** but **felt more familiar** to developers coming from TypeScript, Rust, or Go?

FunC gave complete control over the TVM — and if you mastered it, it gave you power.
But its Lisp-like syntax and functional style made onboarding difficult for many.

Tolk began as an experiment: to maintain efficiency while changing the interface.
No Lisp-style prefix notation; familiar C-style syntax, with clean types, structs, pattern matching, and a modern toolchain.

Since then, Tolk has grown far beyond just being **easier FunC**. It now offers:
- a powerful type system,
- automatic serialization,
- idiomatic message composition,
- and better performance — not despite abstraction, but thanks to it.

Today, Tolk is not an experiment — it's a production-ready replacement for FunC (see [Is Tolk production-ready?](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/tolk/overview#is-tolk-production-ready)).

## How Tolk was born

In June 2024, I submitted a pull request: [FunC v0.5.0](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/pull/1026) — along with a roadmap for how FunC could be improved, syntactically and semantically.

But instead of merging it, we made a decision: **To fork**.
To leave FunC untouched. As it is. As it always was. And to create a new language driven by a new name.

Over the next several months, I worked on Tolk privately, implementing not just syntax changes,
but a fully redesigned architecture — including an internal AST representation that FunC never had.

At TON Gateway in Dubai in November 2024, I gave a speech presenting Tolk to the public.
The video is available [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Frq-HUYGdbI).

The very first pull request: [Tolk Language: next-generation FunC](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/pull/1345).

The first released version of Tolk was **v0.6** — a metaphor for the **FunC v0.5** that could have been but never was.

## Meaning of the name "Tolk"

**Tolk** is a wonderful word. 

In English, it sounds like *talk*. And after all, what do we use a language for? To talk. To talk to computers. 

In many Slavic languages, the root *tolk* and the phrase "to have tolk" mean "to make sense"; "to have deep internals".

But actually, **TOLK** is an abbreviation.  
You know that TON is **The Open Network**.  
By analogy, TOLK is **The Open Language K**.   

What is K, you might ask? Maybe it's *kot* — the nickname of Nikolay Durov? Or Kolya? Kitten? Kernel? Kit? Knowledge?  
The correct answer is none of these. The K stands for nothing. It's open.
*The Open Letter K*
