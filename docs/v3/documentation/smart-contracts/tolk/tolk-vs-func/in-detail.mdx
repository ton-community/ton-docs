# Tolk vs FunC: in detail

A huge list is below. Will anyone have enough patience to read it up to the end?..

### Traditional comments

<table className="cmp-func-tolk-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>FunC</th>
      <th>Tolk</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>
          {';; comment'}
        </code>
      </td>

      <td>
        <code>

### 2+2 is 4, not an identifier. Identifiers can only be alpha-numeric

In FunC, almost any character can be a part of the identifier.
For example, `2+2` (without a space) is an identifier.
You can even declare a variable with such a name.

In Tolk, spaces are not mandatory. `2+2` is 4, as expected. `3+~x` is `3 + (~ x)`, and so on.

<table className="cmp-func-tolk-table different-col-widths">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>FunC</th>
      <th>Tolk</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>
          {'return 2+2;  ;; undefined function `2+2`'}
        </code>
      </td>

      <td>
        <code>
          {'return 2+2;  // 4'}
        </code>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

More precisely, an identifier can start from <code style={{display: 'inline-block'}}>{'[a-zA-Z$_]'}</code>
and be continued with <code style={{display: 'inline-block'}}>{'[a-zA-Z0-9$_]'}</code>. Note that `?`, `:`, and others are not valid symbols, and `found?` and `op::increase` are invalid identifiers.

Note, that `cell`, `slice`, etc. are valid identifiers: `var cell = ...` or even `var cell: cell = ...` is okay. (like in TypeScript, `number` is a valid identifier)

You can use backticks to surround an identifier, and then it can contain any symbols (similar to Kotlin and some other languages). This potential usage is to allow keywords to be used as identifiers in case of code generation by a scheme, for example.

      </td>

### Impure by default, compiler won't drop user function calls

FunC has an `impure` function specifier. When absent, a function is treated as pure. If its result is unused, its call is deleted by the compiler.

Though this behavior is documented, it is very unexpected to newcomers.
For instance, various functions that don't return anything (throw an exception on mismatch, for example)
are silently deleted. This situation is spoilt by FunC not checking and validating the function body,
allowing impure operations inside pure functions.

In Tolk, all functions are impure by default. You can mark a function pure with annotation,
and then impure operations are forbidden in its body (exceptions, globals modification, calling non-pure functions, etc.).

### New functions syntax: fun keyword, @ attributes, types on the right (like in TypeScript, Kotlin, Python, etc.)

<table className="cmp-func-tolk-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>FunC</th>
      <th>Tolk</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>
          {'cell parse_data(slice cs) { }'}
        </code>
      </td>

      <td>
        <code>
          {'fun parse_data(cs: slice): cell { }'}
        </code>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>
          {'(cell, int) load_storage() { }'}
        </code>
      </td>

      <td>
        <code>
          {'fun load_storage(): (cell, int) { }'}
        </code>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>
          {'() main() { ... }'}
        </code>
      </td>

      <td>
        <code>
          {'fun main() { ... }'}
        </code>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Types of variables — also to the right:

<table className="cmp-func-tolk-table different-col-widths">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>FunC</th>
      <th>Tolk</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>
          {'slice cs = ...;'}
        </code>
      </td>

      <td>
        <code>
          {'var cs: slice = ...;'}
        </code>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>
          {'(cell c, int n) = parse_data(cs);'}
        </code>
      </td>

      <td>
        <code>
          {'var (c: cell, n: int) = parse_data(cs);'}
        </code>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>
          {'global int stake_at;'}
        </code>
      </td>

      <td>
        <code>
          {'global stake_at: int'}
        </code>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Modifiers `inline` and others — with annotations:

<table className="cmp-func-tolk-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>FunC</th>
      <th>Tolk</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: '<br>int f(cell s) inline {'}} />
      </td>

      <td>
        <code dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: '@inline<br>fun f(s: cell): int {'}} />
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <code dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: '<br>() load_data() impure inline_ref {'}} />
      </td>

      <td>
        <code dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: '@inline_ref<br>fun load_data() {'}} />
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>
          {'global int stake_at;'}
        </code>
      </td>

      <td>
        <code>
          {'global stake_at: int'}
        </code>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

`forall` — this way:

<table className="cmp-func-tolk-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>FunC</th>
      <th>Tolk</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>
          {'forall X -> tuple cons(X head, tuple tail)'}
        </code>
      </td>

      <td>
        <code dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: 'fun cons&lt;X&gt;(head: X, tail: tuple): tuple'}} />
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

`asm` implementation — like in FunC, but being properly aligned, it looks nicer:

```tolk
@pure
fun third<X>(t: tuple): X
    asm "THIRD"

@pure
fun iDictDeleteGet(dict: cell, keyLen: int, index: int): (cell, slice, int)
    asm(index dict keyLen) "DICTIDELGET NULLSWAPIFNOT"

@pure
fun mulDivFloor(x: int, y: int, z: int): int
    builtin
```

There is also a `@deprecated` attribute, not affecting compilation, but for a human and IDE.

### get instead of method_id

In FunC, `method_id` (without arguments) declared a get method. In Tolk, you use a straightforward syntax:

<table className="cmp-func-tolk-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>FunC</th>
      <th>Tolk</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>
          {'int seqno() method_id { ... }'}
        </code>
      </td>

      <td>
        <code>
          {'get fun seqno(): int { ... }'}
        </code>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

For `method_id(xxx)` (uncommon in practice, but valid), there is an attribute:

<table className="cmp-func-tolk-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>FunC</th>
      <th>Tolk</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: '<br>() after_code_upgrade(cont old_code) impure method_id(1666)'}} />
      </td>

      <td>
        <code dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: '@method_id(1666)<br>fun afterCodeUpgrade(oldCode: continuation)'}} />
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### It's essential to declare types of parameters (though optional for locals)

```tolk
// not allowed
fun do_smth(c, n)
// types are mandatory
fun do_smth(c: cell, n: int)
```

If parameter types are mandatory, the return type is not (it's often obvious or verbose). If omitted, it's auto-inferred:

```tolk
fun x() { ... }  // auto infer from return statements
```

For local variables, types are also optional:

```tolk
var i = 10;                      // ok, int
var b = beginCell();             // ok, builder
var (i, b) = (10, beginCell());  // ok, two variables, int and builder

// types can be specified manually, of course:
var b: builder = beginCell();
var (i: int, b: builder) = (10, beginCell());
```

Defaults for parameters are supported:

```tolk
fun increment(x: int, by: int = 1) {
    return x + by
}
```

### Variables are not allowed to be redeclared in the same scope

```tolk
var a = 10;
...
var a = 20;  // error, correct is just `a = 20`
if (1) {
    var a = 30;  // it's okay, it's another scope
}
```

As a consequence, partial reassignment is not allowed:

```tolk
var a = 10;
...
var (a, b) = (20, 30);  // error, releclaration of a
```

Note, that it's not a problem for `loadUint()` and other methods. In FunC, they returned a modified object, so a pattern `var (cs, int value) = cs.load_int(32)` was quite common. In Tolk, such methods mutate an object: `var value = cs.loadInt(32)`, so redeclaration is unlikely to be needed.

```tolk
fun send(msg: cell) {
    var msg = ...;  // error, redeclaration of msg

    // solution 1: intruduce a new variable
    var msgWrapped = ...;
    // solution 2: use `redef`, though not recommended
    var msg redef = ...;
```

### String postfixes removed, compile-time functions introduced

Tolk removes the old FunC-style string postfixes (`"..."c`, etc.) in favor of a **more transparent and more flexible approach**.

<table className="cmp-func-tolk-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>FunC</th>
      <th>Tolk</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>
          {'"..."c'}
        </code>
      </td>

      <td>
        <code>
          {'stringCrc32("...")'}
        </code>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>—</td>

      <td>
        <code>
          {'stringCrc16("...")'}
        </code>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>
          {'"..."H'}
        </code>
      </td>

      <td>
        <code>
          {'stringSha256("...")'}
        </code>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>
          {'"..."h'}
        </code>
      </td>

      <td>
        <code>
          {'stringSha256_32("...")'}
        </code>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>
          {'"..."a'}
        </code>
      </td>

      <td>
        <code>
          {'address("...")'}
        </code>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>
          {'"..."s'}
        </code>
      </td>

      <td>
        <code>
          {'stringHexToSlice("...")'}
        </code>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>
          {'"..."u'}
        </code>
      </td>

      <td>
        <code>
          {'stringToBase256("...")'}
        </code>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

These functions:

- compile-time only
- for constant strings only
- can be used in constant initialization

```tolk
// type will be `address`
const BASIC_ADDR = address("EQDKbjIcfM6ezt8KjKJJLshZJJSqX7XOA4ff-W72r5gqPrHF")

// return type will be `int`
fun minihashDemo() {
    return stringSha256_32("transfer(slice, int)");
}
```

The naming highlights that these functions have arrived from string postfixes and operate on string values.
Remember that at runtime, there are no strings, only slices.

### Trailing comma support

Tolk now supports trailing commas in the following contexts:

- tensors
- tuples
- function calls
- function parameters

```tolk
var items = (
    totalSupply,
    verifiedCode,
    validatorsList,
);
```

Note that `(5)` is not a tensor. It's just the integer `5` in parentheses.
With a trailing comma `(5,)` it's still `(5)`.

### Optional semicolon for the last statement in a block

In Tolk, you can omit the semicolon after the final statement in a block.
While semicolons are still required between statements, the trailing semicolon on the last statement is now optional.

```tolk
fun f(...) {
	doSomething();
	return result   // <-- valid without semicolon
}

// or
if (smth) {
	return 1
} else {
	return 2
}
```

### Function ton("...") for human-readable amounts of Toncoins

<table className="cmp-func-tolk-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>FunC</th>
      <th>Tolk</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>
          {'int cost = 50000000;'}
        </code>
      </td>

      <td>
        <code>
          {'val cost = ton("0.05");'}
        </code>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>
          {'const ONE_TON = 1000000000;'}
        </code>
      </td>

      <td>
        <code>
          {'const ONE_TON = ton("1")'}
        </code>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The function `ton()` only accepts constant values (e.g., `ton(some_var)` is invalid).
Its type is `coins` (not `int`!), although it's still a regular `int` from the TVM point of view.
Arithmetic over `coins` degrade to `int` (for example, `cost << 1` is valid, `cost + ton("0.02")` also).

### Changes in the type system

FunC's type system is based on Hindley-Milner. This is a common approach for functional languages, where types are inferred from usage through unification.

In Tolk v0.7, the type system is rewritten from scratch.
In order to add booleans, fixed-width integers, nullability, structures, and generics, we must have a static type system (like TypeScript or Rust).
Because Hindley-Milner will clash with structure methods, struggle with proper generics, and become entirely impractical for union types (despite claims that it was _designed for union types_).

We have the following types:

- `int`, `bool`, `cell`, `slice`, `builder`, untyped `tuple`
- typed tuple `[T1, T2, ...]`
- tensor `(T1, T2, ...)`
- callables `(TArgs) -> TResult`
- nullable types `T?`, compile-time null safety
- union types `T1 | T2 | ...`, handled with pattern matching
- `coins` and function `ton("0.05")`
- `int32`, `uint64`, and other fixed-width integers (just int at TVM) [details](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/pull/1559)
- `bytesN` and `bitsN`, similar to `intN` (backed by slices at TVM)
- `address` (internal/external/none, still a slice at TVM)
- `void` (more canonical to be named `unit`, but `void` is more reliable)
- `self`, to make chainable methods, described below; actually it's not a type, it can only occur instead of return type of a function
- `never` (an always-throwing function returns `never`, for example; an _impossible type_ is also `never`)
- structures and generics

The type system obeys the following rules:

- variable types can be specified manually or are inferred from declarations, and never change after being declared
- function parameters must be strictly typed
- function return types, if unspecified, inferred from return statements similar to TypeScript; in case of recursion (direct or indirect), the return type must be explicitly declared somewhere
- generic functions are supported

### Clear and readable error messages on type mismatch

In FunC, due to Hindley-Milner, type mismatch errors are very hard to understand:

```
error: previous function return type (int, int)
cannot be unified with implicit end-of-block return type (int, ()):
cannot unify type () with int
```

In Tolk, they are human-readable:

```
1) can not assign `(int, slice)` to variable of type `(int, int)`
2) can not call method for `builder` with object of type `int`
3) can not use `builder` as a boolean condition
4) missing `return`
...
```

### bool type, casting boolVar as int

Under the hood, **`bool` is still -1 and 0 at TVM level**, but from the type system's perspective, `bool` and `int` are now different.

Comparison operators `== / >= /...` return `bool`. Logical operators `&& ||` return `bool`. Constants `true` and `false` have the `bool` type.
Lots of stdlib functions now return `bool`, not `int` (having -1 and 0 at runtime):

```tolk
var valid = isSignatureValid(...);    // bool
var end = cs.isEnd();                 // bool
```

Operator `!x` supports both `int` and `bool`. Condition of `if` and similar accepts both `int` (!= 0) and `bool`.
Logical `&&` and `||` accept both `bool` and `int`, preserving compatibility with constructs like `a && b` where `a` and `b` are integers (!= 0).

Arithmetic operators are restricted to integers, only bitwise and logical allowed for bools:

```tolk
valid && end;    // ok
valid & end;     // ok, bitwise & | ^ also work if both are bools
if (!end)        // ok

if (~end)        // error, use !end
valid + end;     // error
8 & valid;       // error, int & bool not allowed
```

Note, that logical operators `&& ||` (missed in FunC) use IF/ELSE asm representation always.
In the future, for optimization, they could be automatically replaced by `& |` when it's safe (example: `a > 0 && a < 10`).
To manually optimize gas consumption, you can still use `& |` (allowed for bools), but remember, that they are not short-circuit.

**`bool` can be cast to `int` via `as` operator**:

```tolk
var i = boolValue as int;  // -1 / 0
```

There are no runtime transformations. `bool` is guaranteed to be -1/0 at TVM level, so this is type-only casting.
But generally, if you need such a cast, probably you're doing something wrong (unless you're doing a tricky bitwise optimization).

### Generic functions and instantiations like f\<int>(...)

Tolk introduces properly made generic functions. Their syntax reminds mainstream languages:

```tolk
fun replaceNulls<T1, T2>(tensor: (T1?, T2?), v1IfNull: T1, v2IfNull: T2): (T1, T2) {
    var (a, b) = tensor;
    return (a == null ? v1IfNull : a, b == null ? v2IfNull : b);
}
```

A generic parameter `T` may be something complex.

```tolk
fun duplicate<T>(value: T): (T, T) {
    var copy: T = value;
    return (value, copy);
}

duplicate(1);         // duplicate<int>
duplicate([1, cs]);   // duplicate<[int, slice]>
duplicate((1, 2));    // duplicate<(int, int)>
```

Or even functions, it also works:

```tolk
fun callAnyFn<TObj, TResult>(f: TObj -> TResult, arg: TObj) {
    return f(arg);
}

fun callAnyFn2<TObj, TCallback>(f: TCallback, arg: TObj) {
    return f(arg);
}
```

Note that while generic `T` is mostly detected from arguments, there are no such obvious corner cases when `T` does not depend on arguments:

```tolk
fun tupleLast<T>(t: tuple): T
    asm "LAST"

var last = tupleLast(t);    // error, can not deduce T
```

To make this valid, `T` should be provided externally:

```tolk
var last: int = tupleLast(t);       // ok, T=int
var last = tupleLast<int>(t);       // ok, T=int
var last = tupleLast(t) as int;     // ok, T=int

someF(tupleLast(t));       // ok, T=(paremeter's declared type)
return tupleLast(t);       // ok if function specifies return type
```

Also note that `T` for asm functions must occupy one stack slot, whereas for a user-defined function, `T` could be of any shape. Otherwise, asm body is unable to handle it properly.

### #include → import. Strict imports

In Tolk, you can not use a symbol from `a.tolk` without importing this file. In other words, **import what you use**.

All stdlib functions are available out of the box. Downloading stdlib and `#include "stdlib.fc"` is unnecessary. See below about embedded stdlib.

There is still a global scope of naming. If `f` is declared in two different files, it's an error. We `import` a whole file with no per-file visibility, and the `export` keyword is now supported but probably will be in the future.

### #pragma → compiler options

In FunC, **experimental** features like `allow-post-modifications` were turned on by a pragma in `.fc` files (leading to problems when some files contain it, some don't). Indeed, it's not a pragma for a file, it's a compilation option.

In Tolk, all pragmas were removed. `allow-post-modification` and `compute-asm-ltr` were merged into Tolk sources (as if they were always on in FunC). Instead of pragmas, there is now an ability to pass experimental options.

As for now, there is one experimental option introduced — `remove-unused-functions`, which doesn't include unused symbols to Fift output.

`#pragma version xxx` was replaced by `tolk xxx` (no >=, just a strict version). It's good practice to annotate the compiler version you are using. If it doesn't match, Tolk will show a warning.

```tolk
tolk 0.12
```

### Late symbols resolving. AST representation

In FunC, like in С, you can not access a function declared below:

```func
int b() { a(); }   ;; error
int a() { ... }    ;; since it's declared below
```

To avoid an error, a programmer should first create a forward declaration. The reason is that symbol resolution is performed right during parsing.

Tolk compiler separates these two steps. At first, it does parsing, and then it does symbol resolving. Hence, a snippet above would not be erroneous.

It sounds simple, but internally, it's a very huge job. To make this available, I've introduced an intermediate AST representation, which was completely missed in FunC. That's an essential point for future modifications and performing semantic code analysis.

### null keyword

Creating null values and checking variables on null looks very pretty now.

### throw and assert keywords

Tolk dramatically simplifies working with exceptions.

If FunC has `throw()`, `throw_if()`, `throw_arg_if()`, and the same for unless, Tolk has only two primitives: `throw` and `assert`.

<table className="cmp-func-tolk-table different-col-widths">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>FunC</th>
      <th>Tolk</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>
          {'throw(excNo)'}
        </code>
      </td>

      <td>
        <code>
          {'throw excNo'}
        </code>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>
          {'throw_arg(arg, excNo)'}
        </code>
      </td>

      <td>
        <code>
          {'throw (excNo, arg)'}
        </code>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>
          {'throw_unless(excNo, condition)'}
        </code>
      </td>

      <td>
        <code>
          {'assert(condition, excNo)'}
        </code>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>
          {'throw_if(excNo, condition)'}
        </code>
      </td>

      <td>
        <code>
          {'assert(!condition, excNo)'}
        </code>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Note, that `!condition` is possible since logical NOT is available, see below.

There is a long (verbose) syntax of `assert(condition, excNo)`:

```tolk
assert(condition) throw excNo;
// with a possibility to include arg to throw
```

Also, Tolk swaps `catch` arguments: it's `catch (excNo, arg)`, both optional (since arg is most likely empty).

### Operator precedence became identical to C++ / JavaScript

In FunC, such code `if (slices_equal() & status == 1)` is parsed as `if( (slices_equal()&status) == 1 )`. This approach is a reason for various errors in real-world contracts.

In Tolk, `&` has a lower priority, which is identical to C++ and JavaScript.

Moreover, Tolk fires errors on potentially wrong operators' usage to eliminate such errors:

```tolk
if (flags & 0xFF != 0)
```

will lead to a compilation error (similar to gcc/clang):

```
& has lower precedence than ==, probably this code won't work as you expected.  Use parenthesis: either (... & ...) to evaluate it first, or (... == ...) to suppress this error.
```

Hence, you should rewrite the code:

```tolk
// either to evaluate it first (our case)
if ((flags & 0xFF) != 0)
// or to emphasize the behavior (not our case here)
if (flags & (0xFF != 0))
```

I've also added a diagnostic for a common mistake in bitshift operators: `a << 8 + 1` is equivalent to `a << 9`, probably unexpected.

```
int result = a << 8 + low_mask;

error: << has lower precedence than +, probably this code won't work as you expected.  Use parenthesis: either (... << ...) to evaluate it first, or (... + ...) to suppress this error.
```

Operators `~% ^% /% ~/= ^/= ~%= ^%= ~>>= ^>>=` no longer exist.

### Immutable variables, declared via val

Like in Kotlin: `var` for mutable, `val` for immutable, optionally followed by a type. FunC has no analogue of `val`.

```tolk
val flags = msgBody.loadMessageFlags();
flags &= 1;         // error, modifying an immutable variable

val cs: slice = c.beginParse();
cs.loadInt(32);     // error, since loadInt() mutates an object
cs.preloadInt(32);  // ok, it's a read-only method
```

Parameters of a function are mutable, but since they are copied by value, called arguments aren't changed. Exactly like in FunC, just to clarify.

```tolk
fun some(x: int) {
    x += 1;
}

val origX = 0;
some(origX);      // origX remains 0

fun processOpIncrease(msgBody: slice) {
    val flags = msgBody.loadInt(32);
    ...
}

processOpIncrease(msgBody);  // by value, not modified
```

In Tolk, a function can declare `mutate` parameters. It's a generalization of FunC `~` tilda functions, read below.

### Deprecated command-line options removed

Command-line flags `-A`, `-P`, and others were removed. Default behavior

```
/path/to/tolk {inputFile}
```

is more than enough. Use `-v` to print version and exit. Use `-h` for all available command-line flags.

Only one input file can be passed, others should be `import`'ed.

### stdlib functions renamed to ~~verbose~~ clear names, camelCase style

All names in the standard library were reconsidered. Now, functions are called using longer but clear names.

A former "stdlib.fc" was split into multiple files: common.tolk, tvm-dicts.tolk, and others.

In Tolk, stdlib a part of distribution. Standard library is inseparable, since keeping a triple **language, compiler, stdlib** together is the only correct way to maintain release cycle.

It works in such a way. Tolk compiler knows how to locate a standard library. If a user has installed an apt package, stdlib sources were also downloaded and exist on a hard disk, so the compiler locates them by system paths. If a user uses a WASM wrapper, they are provided by tolk-js. And so on.

Standard library is split into multiple files: `common.tolk` (most common functions), `gas-payments.tolk` (calculating gas fees), `tvm-dicts.tolk`, and others. Functions from `common.tolk` are available always (a compiler implicitly imports it). Other files are needed to be explicitly imported:

```tolk
import "@stdlib/tvm-dicts"   // ".tolk" optional

...
var dict = createEmptyDict();
dict.iDictSet(...);
```

Mind the rule **import what you use**, it's applied to `@stdlib/...` files also (with the only exception of `common.tolk`).

JetBrains IDE plugin automatically discovers stdlib folder and inserts necessary imports as you type.

### Logical operators && ||, logical not !

In FunC, there are only bitwise operators `~ & | ^`. Developers making first steps, thinking "okay, no logical, I'll use bitwise in the same manner", often do errors, since operator behavior is completely different:

Tolk supports logical operators. They behave exactly as you get used to (right column). For now, `&&` and `||` sometimes produce not optimal Fift code, but in the future, Tolk compiler will become smarter in this case. It's negligible, just use them like in other languages.

Keywords `ifnot` and `elseifnot` were removed, since now we have logical not (for optimization, Tolk compiler generates `IFNOTJMP`, btw). The `elseif` keyword  was replaced by the traditional `else if`.

Remember that a boolean `true`, transformed `as int`, is -1, not 1. It's a TVM representation.

### Indexed access tensorVar.0 and tupleVar.0

Use `tensorVar.{i}` to access i-th component of a tensor. Modifying it will change the tensor.

```tolk
var t = (5, someSlice, someBuilder);   // 3 stack slots
t.0         			// 5
t.0 = 10;   			// t is now (10, ...)
t.0 += 1;               // t is now (11, ...)
increment(mutate t.0);  // t is now (12, ...)
t.0.increment();        // t is now (13, ...)

t.1         // slice
t.100500    // compilation error
```

Use `tupleVar.{i}` to access i-th element of a tuple (does INDEX under the hood). Modifying it will change the tuple (does SETINDEX under the hood).

```tolk
var t = [5, someSlice, someBuilder];   // 1 tuple on a stack with 3 items
t.0                     // "0 INDEX", reads 5
t.0 = 10;               // "0 SETINDEX", t is now [10, ...]
t.0 += 1;               // also works: "0 INDEX" to read 10, "0 SETINDEX" to write 11
increment(mutate t.0);  // also, the same way
t.0.increment();        // also, the same way

t.1         // "1 INDEX", it's slice
t.100500    // compilation error
```

It also works for untyped tuples, though the compiler can't guarantee index correctness.

```tolk
var t = createEmptyTuple();
t.tuplePush(5);
t.0                     // will head 5
t.0 = 10                // t will be [10]
t.100500                // will fail at runtime
```

It works for nesting `var.{i}.{j}`. It works for nested tensor, nested tuples, tuples nested into tensors.
It works for `mutate`. It works for globals.

```tolk
t.1.2 = 10;    // "1 INDEX" + "2 SETINDEX" + "1 SETINDEX"
t.1.2 += 10;   // "1 INDEX" + "2 INDEX" + sum + "2 SETINDEX" + "1 SETINDEX"

globalTuple.1.2 += 10;  // "GETGLOB" + ... + "SETGLOB"
```

### Type address

In TVM, all **binary data** is just **a slice.** Same goes for addresses: while TL-B describes the entity `MsgAddress` (internal/external/none/var address),

and TVM assembler has instructions to load/validate addresses, nevertheless: at the low level, it's just a slice.
That's why in FunC's standard library `loadAddress` returned `slice`, and `storeAddress` accepted `slice`.

Tolk introduces the dedicated `address` type. It's still a TVM slice at runtime (internal/external/none),
but it differs from an **abstract slice** from the type system point of view:

1. Integrated with auto-serialization: compiler knows how to pack/unpack it (`LDMSGADDR` and `STSLICE`)
2. Comparable: operators `==` and `!=` work on addresses:

```tolk
if (senderAddress == msg.owner)
```

3. Introspectable: `address.isNone()`, `address.isInternal()`, `address.isExternal()`, `address.getWorkchain()` and `address.getWorkchainAndHash()` (valid for internal addresses)

Passing a slice instead leads to an error:

```tolk
var a: slice = s.loadAddress();  // error, can not assign `address` to `slice`
```

**Embedding a const address into a contract**

Use the built-in `address()` function, which accepts a standard address. In FunC, there was a postfix `"..."a` that returned a slice.

```tolk
address("EQCRDM9h4k3UJdOePPuyX40mCgA4vxge5Dc5vjBR8djbEKC5")
address("0:527964d55cfa6eb731f4bfc07e9d025098097ef8505519e853986279bd8400d8")
```

**Casting `slice` to `address` and vice versa**

If you have a raw slice, which is actually an address, you can cast it via `as` operator.
In practice, this can occur if you've composed an address with a builder, having manually written its binary representation:

```tolk
var b = beginCell()
       .storeUint(0b01)   // addr_extern
       ...;
var s = b.endCell().beginParse();
return s as address;   // `slice` as `address`
```

A reversed cast also is valid: `someAddr as slice` (why would you need it, is an open question, though).

**Different types of addresses**

According to a standard, there are different types of addresses. The most frequently used is a **standard address** — just and address of a smart contract, like `EQ...`. But also, there are **external** and **none** addresses. In a binary TL-B representation,

- `10` (**internal** prefix) + `0` (anycast, always 0) + workchain (8 bits) + hash (256 bits) — that's `EQ...`: it's 267 bits
- `01` (**external** prefix) + len (9 bits) + len bits — external addresses
- `00` (**none** prefix) — address **none**, 2 bits

The `address` type can hold any of these. Most often, it's an internal address. But the type system does not restrict it exactly: this can't be done without heavy runtime checks.

So, if `address` comes from an untrusted input, you should probably validate it:

```tolk
val newOwner = msg.nextOwnerAddress;
assert(newOwner.isInternal()) throw 403;
assert(newOwner.getWorkchain() == BASECHAIN) throw 403;
```

All in all, if you don't trust inputs — you should validate everything: numbers, payload, and addresses particularly.
But if an input comes from a trusted source (your own contract storage, for example) — of course, you can rely on its contents.
The compiler does not insert hidden instructions.
Just remember, that `address` in general can hold all valid types.

### Type aliases type NewName = \<existing type>

Tolk supports type aliases, similar to TypeScript and Rust.
An alias creates a new name for an existing type but **remains interchangeable with it**.

```tolk
type UserId = int32
type MaybeOwnerHash = bytes32?

fun calcHash(id: UserId): MaybeOwnerHash { ... }

var id: UserId = 1;       // ok
var num: int = id;        // ok
var h = calcHash(id);
if (h != null) {
    h as slice;           // bytes32 as slice
}
```

### Nullable types T?, null safety, smart casts, operator !

Tolk has nullable types: `int?`, `cell?`, and `T?` in general (even for tensors).
Non-nullable types, such as `int` and `cell`, can never hold null values.

The compiler enforces **null safety**: you cannot use nullable types without first checking for null.
Fortunately, these checks integrate smoothly and organically into the code thanks to smart casts.
Smart casts are purely a compile-time feature — they do not consume gas or extra stack space.

```tolk
var value = x > 0 ? 1 : null;  // int?

value + 5;               // error
s.storeInt(value);       // error

if (value != null) {
    value + 5;           // ok, smart cast
    s.storeInt(value);   // ok, smart cast
}
```

Remember that when a variable's type is not specified, it's auto-inferred from the assignment and never changes:

```tolk
var i = 0;
i = null;       // error, can't assign `null` to `int`
i = maybeInt;   // error, can't assign `int?` to `int`
```

Such a code will not work. You must **explicitly declare the variable as nullable**::

```tolk
// incorrect
var i = null;
if (...) {
    i = 0;     // error
}

// correct
var i: int? = null;
// or
var i = null as int?;
```

Smart casts (similar to TypeScript and Kotlin) make it easier to deal with nullable types, allowing code like this:

```tolk
if (lastCell != null) {
    // here lastCell is `cell`, not `cell?`
}
```

```tolk
if (lastCell == null || prevCell == null) {
    return;
}
// both lastCell and prevCell are `cell`
```

```tolk
var x: int? = ...;
if (x == null) {
    x = random();
}
// here x is `int`
```

```tolk
while (lastCell != null) {
    lastCell = lastCell.beginParse().loadMaybeRef();
}
// here lastCell is 100% null
```

```tolk
// t: (int, int)?
t.0                // error
t!.0               // ok
if (t.0 != null) {
    t.0            // ok
}
```

Note that smart casts don't work for globals; they only work for local vars.

Tolk has the `!` operator (non-null assertion, compile-time only), like `!` in TypeScript and `!!` in Kotlin.
If you are certain that a variable is not null,
this operator allows you to skip the compiler's check.

```tolk
fun doSmth(c: cell);

fun analyzeStorage(nCells: int, lastCell: cell?) {
    if (nCells) {           // then lastCell 100% not null
        doSmth(lastCell!);  // use ! for this fact
    }
}
```

In practice, you'll use this operator working with low-level dicts API.
Tolk will have a high-level `map<K,V>` in the future.
For now, working with dicts will require the `!` operator.

```tolk
// it returns either (slice, true) or (null, false)
@pure
fun dict.iDictGet(self, keyLen: int, key: int): (slice?, bool)
    asm(key self keyLen) "DICTIGET" "NULLSWAPIFNOT"

var (cs, exists) = myDict.iDictGet(...);
// if exists is true, cs is not null
if (exists) {
    cs!.loadInt(32);
}
```

You can also declare **always-throwing functions** that return `never`:

```tolk
fun alwaysThrows(): never {
    throw 123;
}

fun f(x: int) {
    if (x > 0) {
        return x;
    }
    alwaysThrows();
    // no `return` statement needed
}
```

The `never` type implicitly occurs when a condition can never happen:

```tolk
var v = 0;
// prints a warning
if (v == null) {
    // v is `never`
    v + 10;   // error, can not apply `+` `never` and `int`
}
// v is `int` again
```

If you encounter `never` in compilation errors, there is most likely a warning in the preceding code.

Non-atomic nullable are also allowed: `(int, int)?`, `(int?, int?)?`, or even `()?`. Then,
a special _value presence_ stack slot is implicitly added.
It holds `0` if a value is null, and not 0 (currently, -1) if not null:

```tolk
// t: (int, int)?
t = (1, 2);    // 1 2 -1
t = (3, 4);    // 3 4 -1
t = null;      // null null 0

// t: ()?
t = ();         // -1
t = null;       // 0
```

All in all, nullability is a significant step forward for type safety and reliability.
Nullable types eliminate runtime errors, enforcing correct handling of optional values.

### Union types T1 | T2 | ..., operators match, is, !is

Union types allow a variable to hold multiple possible types, similar to TypeScript.

```tolk
fun whatFor(a: bits8 | bits256): slice | UserId { ... }

var result = whatFor(...);  // slice | UserId
```

Nullable types `T?` are now formally `T | null`.
Union types have intersection properties. For instance, `B | C` can be passed/assigned to `A | B | C | D`.

The only way to work with unions from code is **pattern matching**:

```tolk
match (result) {
    slice  => { /* result is smart-casted to slice  */ }
    UserId => { /* result is smart-casted to UserId */ }
}
```

Example:

```tolk
match (result) {
    slice => {
        return result.loadInt(32);
    }
    UserId => {
        if (result < 0) {
            throw 123;
        }
        return loadUser(result).parentId;
    }
}
```

`match` must cover all union cases (should be _exhaustive_). It can also be **used as an expression**:

```tolk
type Pair2 = (int, int)
type Pair3 = (int, int, int)

fun getLast(tensor: Pair2 | Pair3) {
    return match (tensor) {
        Pair2 => tensor.1,
        Pair3 => tensor.2,
    }
}
```

Syntax details:

- commas are optional with {} but required for expressions
- a trailing comma is allowed
- semicolon is not required after `match` used as a statement
- for match-expressions, its arm can terminate, then its type is considered `never`:

```tolk
return match (msg) {
    ...
    CounterReset => throw 403,  // forbidden
}
```

Variable declaration inside `match` is allowed:

```tolk
match (val v = getPair2Or3()) {
    Pair2 => {
        // use v.0 and v.1
    }
    Pair3 => {
        // use v.0, v.1, and v.2
    }
}
```

<details>
  <summary>How are union types represented on the stack, at the TVM level?</summary>

  Internally, at the TVM level, they are stored as tagged unions, like enums in Rust:

  - each type is assigned a unique type ID, which is stored alongside the value
  - the union occupies N + 1 stack slots, where N is the maximum size of any type in the union
  - a nullable type `T?` is just a union with null (type ID = 0); `int?` and other atomics still use 1 stack slot

  ```tolk
  var v: int | slice;    // 2 stack slots: value and typeID
                         // - int:   (100, 0xF831)
                         // - slice: (CS{...}, 0x29BC)
  match (v) {
      int =>     // IF TOP == 0xF831 { ... }
          // v.slot1 contains int, can be used in arithmetics
      slice =>   // ELSE { IF TOP == 0x29BC { ... } }
          // v.slot1 contains slice, can be used to loadInt()
  }

  fun complex(v: int | slice | (int, int)) {
      // Stack representation:
      // - int:        (null, 100, 0xF831)
      // - slice:      (null, CS{...}, 0x29BC)
      // - (int, int): (200, 300, 0xA119)
  }

  complex(v);   // passes (null, v.slot1, v.typeid)
  complex(5);   // passes (null, 5, 0xF831)
  ```
</details>

Besides `match`, you can test a union type by `is`. Smart casts work as expected:

```tolk
fun f(v: cell | slice | builder) {
    if (v is cell) {
        v.cellHash();
    } else {
        // v is `slice | builder`
        if (v !is builder) { return }
        // v is `slice`
        v.sliceHash();
    }
    // v is `cell | slice`
    if (v is int) {
        // v is `never`
        // a warning is also printed, condition is always false
    }
}
```

### Pattern matching for expressions (switch-like behavior)

`match` can also be used for **constant expressions**, similar to `switch`:

```tolk
val nextValue = match (curValue) {
    1 => 0,
    0 => 1,
    else => -1
};
```

Rules:

- only constant expressions are allowed on the left-hand side (1, SOME_CONST, 2 + 3)
- branches can contain `return` and `throw`
- `else` is required for expression form but optional for statement form:

```tolk
// statement form
match (curValue) {
    1 => { nextValue = 0 }
    0 => { nextValue = 1 }
    -1 => throw NEGATIVE_NOT_ALLOWED
}

// expression form, else branch required
val nextValue = match (curValue) {
    ...
    else => <expression>
}
```

### Structures

Looks like TypeScript — but works in TVM!

```tolk
struct Point {
    x: int
    y: int
}

fun calcMaxCoord(p: Point) {
    return p.x > p.y ? p.x : p.y;
}

// declared like a JS object
var p: Point = { x: 10, y: 20 };
calcMaxCoord(p);

// called like a JS object
calcMaxCoord({ x: 10, y: 20 });

// works with shorthand syntax
fun createPoint(x: int, y: int): Point {
    return { x, y }
}
```

- a struct is just **a named tensor**
- `Point` is identical to `(int, int)` at the TVM level
- field access `p.x` works like accessing tensor elements `t.0`, for reading and writing

This means **no bytecode overhead** — you can replace unreadable tensors with clean, structured types.

Fields can be separated by newlines (recommended) or by `;` / `,` (both are valid, like in TypeScript).

When creating an object, you can specify `StructName { ... }` or simply `{ ... }` if the type is clear from the context (e.g., return type or assignment):

```tolk
var s: StoredInfo = { counterValue, ... };
var s: (int, StoredInfo) = (0, { counterValue, ... });

// also valid
var s = StoredInfo { counterValue, ... };
```

Default values for fields are supported:

```tolk
struct DefDemo {
    f1: int = 0
    f2: int? = null
    f3: (int, coins) = (0, ton("0.05"))
}

var d: DefDemo = {};         // ok
var d: DefDemo = { f2: 5 };  // ok
```

Structs can have methods as extension functions, read below.

### Generic structs and aliases

They exist only at the type level (no runtime cost).

```tolk
struct Container<T> {
    isAllowed: bool
    element: T?
}

struct Nothing

type Wrapper<T> = Nothing | Container<T>
```

Example usage:

```tolk
fun checkElement(c: Container<T>) {
    return c.element != null;
}

var c: Container<int32> = { isAllowed: false, element: null };

var v: Wrapper<int> = Nothing {};
var v: Wrapper<int32> = Container { value: 0 };
```

Since it's a generic, you should specify type arguments when using it:

```tolk
fun getItem(c: Container)        // error, specify type arguments
fun getItem(c: Container<int>)   // ok
fun getItem<T>(c: Container<T>)  // ok

var c: Container = { ... }       // error, specify type arguments
var c: Container<int> = { ... }  // ok
```

When you declare a generic function, the compiler can automatically infer type arguments for a call:

```tolk
fun doSmth<T>(value: Container<T>) { ... }

doSmth({ item: 123 });         // T = int
doSmth({ item: cellOrNull });  // T = cell?
```

Demo: `Response<TResult, TError>`:

```tolk
struct Ok<TResult> { result: TResult }
struct Err<TError> { err: TError }

type Response<R, E> = Ok<R> | Err<E>

fun tryLoadMore(slice: slice): Response<cell, int32> {
    return ...
        ? Ok { result: ... }
        : Err { err: ErrorCodes.NO_MORE_REFS }
}

match (val r = tryLoadMore(inMsg)) {
    Ok => { r.result }
    Err => { r.err }
}
```

### Methods: for any types, including structures

Methods are declared as extension functions, similar to Kotlin.
A method can accept the first `self` parameter (then it's an instance method) or not accept it (then it's a static method).

```tolk
fun Point.getX(self) {
    return self.x
}

fun Point.create(x: int, y: int): Point {
    return { x, y }
}
```

Methods can be created **for any type**, including aliases, unions, and built-in types:

```tolk
fun int.isZero(self) {
    return self == 0
}

type MyMessage = CounterIncrement | ...

fun MyMessage.parse(self) { ... }
// this is identical to
// fun (CounterIncrement | ...).parse(self)
```

Methods perfectly work with `asm`, since `self` is just a regular variable:

```tolk
@pure
fun tuple.size(self): int
    asm "TLEN"
```

By default, **`self` is immutable**. It means that you can't modify it or call mutating methods.
To make `self` mutable, you should explicitly declare `mutate self`:

```tolk
fun Point.assignX(mutate self, x: int) {
    self.x = x;   // without mutate, an error "modifying immutable object"
}

fun builder.storeInt32(mutate self, v: int32): self {
    return self.storeInt(v, 32);
}
```

Methods for generic structs created seamlessly.
Note, that no extra `<T>` is required: while parsing the receiver type, compiler treats unknown symbols as generic arguments.

```tolk
struct Container<T> {
    item: T
}

// compiler treats T (unknown symbol) as a generic parameter
fun Container<T>.getItem(self) {
    return self.item;
}

// and this is a specialization for integer containers
fun Container<int>.getItem(self) {
    ...
}
```

Another example:

```tolk
struct Pair<T1, T2> {
    first: T1
    second: T2
}

// both <T1,T2>, <A,B>, etc. work: any unknown symbols
fun Pair<A, B>.create(f: A, s: B): Pair<A, B> {
    return {
        first: f,
        second: s,
    }
}
```

Similarly, any unknown symbol (typically, `T`) can be used to make a method accepting anything:

```tolk
// any receiver
fun T.copy(self): T {
    return self;
}

// any nullable receiver
fun T?.isNull(self): bool {
    return self == null;
}
```

When you call `someObj.method()`, multiple methods with the same name may exist and theoretically be acceptable:

```tolk
fun T.copy(self) { ... }
fun int.copy(self) { ... }

someVar.copy();   // ???
```

So, the compiler performs matching to find as precise method as follows:

1. Search for exact type receiver like `int.copy` (most practical cases finish here)
2. Search for non-generic receivers that are acceptable (like `int32.copy` / `int?.copy`)
3. Search for generic receivers except `T` (like `Container<T>.copy`)
4. Search for `T` receivers (`T.copy`)

```tolk
fun int.copy(self) { ... }
fun T.copy(self) { ... }

6.copy()              // int.copy (rule 1)
(6 as int32).copy()   // int.copy (rule 2)
(6 as int32?).copy()  // T.copy with T=int? (rule 4)
```

```tolk
type MyMessage = CounterIncrement | CounterReset
fun MyMessage.check() { ... }
fun CounterIncrement.check() { ... }

MyMessage{...}.check()         // first (rule 1)
CounterIncrement{...}.check()  // second (rule 1)
CounterReset{...}.check()      // first (rule 2)
```

In case of ambiguity, an error is printed:

```tolk
fun int?.doSmth(self) { ... }
fun int64.doSmth(self) { ... }

var v: int32;
v.doSmth();   // error: no exact match, but two possible acceptable receivers
```

You can assign a generic function to the variable, but you should explicitly specify types:

```tolk
fun genericFn<T>(v: T) { ... }
fun Container<T>.getItem(self) { ... }

var callable1 = genericFn<slice>;
var callable2 = Container<int32>.getItem;
callable2(someContainer32);   // pass it as self
```

### Auto-detect and inline functions

Tolk can inline functions at the compiler level, NOT via `PROCINLINE` by Fift.

```tolk
fun Point.create(x: int, y: int): Point {
    return {x, y}
}

fun Point.getX(self) {
    return self.x
}

fun sum(a: int, b: int) {
    return a + b;
}

fun main() {
    var p = Point.create(10, 20);
    return sum(p.getX(), p.y);
}
```

is compiled just to

```fift
main PROC:<{
  30 PUSHINT
}>
```

The compiler automatically detects what functions to inline. The attribute `@inline` also forces compiler inlining. The attribute `@noinline` forces a function to stay in a dict, `@inline_ref` remains "inline ref" (perfect for "unlikely" execution paths).

Compiler inlining is efficient in terms of stack manipulations. It works with arguments of any stack width. It works with any functions and methods, except recursive or having `return` in the middle. It works with `mutate` and `self`.

You should not worry that "simple getters" like `fun Point.getX(self) { return self.x }` will require stack reordering. You can extract small functions, they are absolutely zero-cost. You don't think about `@inline` and Fift, because no inlining is deferred to Fift: the compiler will handle everything in advance.

**How does "auto-inline" work?**

In two words,

- "simple small functions" are inlined always
- if a function is called only once, it's inlined

Some details. For every function, the compiler calculates "weight" (a heuristic AST-based metric) and usages count. If "weight \< THRESHOLD," it's inlined always. If "usages == 1," it's inlined always. Otherwise, there is some empiric formula.

No one prevents you to force `@inline` annotation for "big functions" also. For example, if you know that all usages correspond to hot paths. Sometimes, on the contrary, you'd want to "prevent inlining" with `@inline_ref` for example, even if a function is called once — if it's an unlikely path. Anyway, if you are keen on optimization, cover your contract with gas benchmarks and experiment with inlining, branch reordering, etc.

**What can NOT be auto-inlined?**

A function will NOT be inlined (even marked as `@inline`) if:

1. It has `return` in the middle. If a function has multiple return points, the compiler can't do anything with it, currently. In Tolk v1.x it will be partially resolved for some use cases.

2. A function that appears in a recursive call chain (`f -> g -> f`). Very unlikely in practice.

3. It's used as non-call. For example, you take a reference to it like `val callback = f`

### No tilda \~ methods, mutate keyword instead

If FunC has `.methods()` and `~methods()`, Tolk has only a dot, and the only way to call a method is `.method()`. Basically, Tolk just works as expected:

```tolk
b.storeUint(x, 32);   // modifies a builder, can be chainable
s.loadUint(32);       // modifies a slice, returns integer
```

Continue reading on a separate page: [Mutability in Tolk](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/tolk/tolk-vs-func/mutability).

### Auto-packing to/from cells/builders/slices

Having any struct, you can unpack in from a cell or pack and object to a cell:

```tolk
struct Point {
    x: int8
    y: int8
}

var value: Point = { x: 10, y: 20 }

// makes a cell containing "0A14"
var c = value.toCell();
// back to { x: 10, y: 20 }
var p = Point.fromCell(c);
```

Continue reading on a separate page: [Auto-packing to/from cells](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/tolk/tolk-vs-func/pack-to-from-cells).

### Universal createMessage: avoid manual cells composition

No more manual `beginCell().storeUint(...).storeRef(...)` boilerplate. Just describe the message in a literal, and let the compiler do the rest.

```tolk
val reply = createMessage({
    bounce: false,
    value: ton("0.05"),
    dest: senderAddress,
    body: RequestedInfo { ... }
});
reply.send(SEND_MODE_REGULAR);
```

Continue reading on a separate page: [Universal createMessage](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/tolk/tolk-vs-func/create-message).

### Modern onInternalMessage

In Tolk, you don't need to manually parse `msg_cell` to retrieve `sender_address` or `fwd_fee`. Everything is pretty straightforward:

```tolk
fun onInternalMessage(in: InMessage) {
    in.senderAddress
    in.originalForwardFee
    in.valueCoins   // typically called "msg value"

    in.|   // IDE suggests you
}
```

While an "old-fashioned way" with accepting 4 parameters like `recv_internal` still works, the above is preferred. Moreover, it's much more efficient: fields of `InMessage` are mapped onto new TVM-11 instructions.

**The pattern**:

1. describe every message in a struct (most likely, with 32-bit opcode)
2. describe a union "allowed messages"
3. `val msg = lazy MyUnion.fromSlice(in.body)`
4. `match (msg)` for every branch, and probably `else`

Do not follow an "old-fashioned way" to extract fwd_fee etc. at the beginning of the function, there is no need of it. Just use `in.smth` on demand.

```tolk
type AllowedMessageToMinter =
    | MintNewJettons
    | BurnNotificationForMinter
    | RequestWalletAddress

fun onInternalMessage(in: InMessage) {
    val msg = lazy AllowedMessageToMinter.fromSlice(in.body);

    match (msg) {
        BurnNotificationForMinter => {
            var storage = lazy MinterStorage.load();
            ...
            storage.save();    
            ...
        }
        RequestWalletAddress => ...
        MintNewJettons => ...
        else => {
            // for example:
            // ignore empty messages, "wrong opcode" for others
            assert (in.body.isEmpty()) throw 0xFFFF
        }
    }
}
```

**A separate `onBouncedMessage`**

In FunC, you parsed `msg_cell`, read 4-bit flags, and tested for `flags & 1` to check whether a message is bounced.

In Tolk, if you want to handle bounces, you create a separate entrypoint:

```tolk
fun onBouncedMessage(in: InMessageBounced) {
}
```

It's automatically called by the compiler, similarly to this:

```tolk
fun onInternalMessage(in: InMessage) {
    // the compiler inserts this automatically:
    if (MSG_IS_BOUNCED) { onBouncedMessage(...); return; }

    ... // your code
}
```

If you don't declare `onBouncedMessage`, all bounces will be just filtered out:

```tolk
fun onInternalMessage(in: InMessage) {
    // the compiler inserts this automatically:
    if (MSG_IS_BOUNCED) { return; }

    ... // your code
}
```

**Remember about 256 bits on bounces**

Currently, TON Blockchain works in such a way that when a message is bounced, only the first 256 bits are present, starting with 0xFFFFFFFF ("bounced prefix"). That's why you manually control which fields you can read (they fit rest 224 bits), which not.

```tolk
fun onBouncedMessage(in: InMessageBounced) {
    in.bouncedBody    // 256 bits

    // typically, you'll do
    in.bouncedBody.skipBouncedPrefix();   // skips 0xFFFFFFFF
    // handle rest of body, probably with lazy match
}
```

<h3>Where to go next?</h3>

Explore the [Tolk vs FunC benchmarks](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/tolk-bench).
These are real-world contracts (Jetton, NFT, Wallet, etc.) migrated from FunC — same logic, but written in a cleaner, more expressive style.

Try a [FunC-to-Tolk converter](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/convert-func-to-tolk). It's a great starting point for incremental migration.

Run `npm create ton@latest` and just start experimenting.
