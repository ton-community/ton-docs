# Tolk vs FunC: in short

Tolk is much more similar to TypeScript and Kotlin than C and Lisp.
But it still provides direct access to TVM assembler for low-level control.

1. Functions are declared via `fun`, get methods via `get fun`, variables via `var`, immutable variables via `val`, putting types on the right; parameter types are mandatory; the return type can be omitted (auto-inferred). Local variable types can also be omitted; attributes like `@inline_ref` use the `@` syntax
```tolk
global storedV: int;

fun parseData(cs: slice): cell {
    var flags: int = cs.loadMessageFlags();
    ...
}

@inline
fun sum(a: int, b: int) {   // auto inferred int
    val both = a + b;       // same
    return both;
}

get fun currentCounter(): int { ... }
```
2. No `impure` needed; functions are impure by default, and the Tolk compiler won't drop user function calls
3. Not `recv_internal` and `recv_external`, but `onInternalMessage` / `onExternalMessage` / `onBouncedMessage`
4. `2+2` is 4, not an identifier; identifiers are alpha-numeric; use naming `const OP_INCREASE` instead of `const op::increase`; `cell` and `slice` are valid identifiers (not keywords)
5. Logical operators AND `&&`, OR `||`, NOT `!` are supported
6. Syntax improvements:
    - `;; comment` → `// comment`
    - `{- comment -}` → `/* comment */`
    - `#include` → `import`, with a strict rule **import what you use**
    - `~ found` → `!found` (for true/false only, obviously) (true is -1, like in FunC)
    - `v = null()` → `v = null`
    - `null?(v)` → `v == null`, same for `builder_null?` and others
    - `~ null?(v)` → `v != null`
    - `throw(excNo)` → `throw excNo`
    - `catch(_, _)` → `catch`
    - `catch(_, excNo)` → `catch(excNo)`
    - `throw_unless(excNo, cond)` → `assert(cond, excNo)`
    - `throw_if(excNo, cond)` → `assert(!cond, excNo)`
    - `return ()` → `return`
    - `do ... until (cond)` → `do ... while (!cond)`
    - `elseif` → `else if`
    - `ifnot (cond)` → `if (!cond)`
    - `"..."c` → `stringCrc32("...")` (and other postfixes also)
7. A function can be called even if declared below; forward declarations not needed; the compiler at first does parsing, and then it does symbol resolving; there is now an AST representation of source code
8. stdlib functions renamed to ~~verbose~~ clear names, camelCase; it's now embedded, not downloaded from GitHub; it's split into several files; common functions available always, more specific available with `import "@stdlib/tvm-dicts"`, the IDE will suggest imports; here is [a mapping](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/tolk/tolk-vs-func/stdlib)
9. No `~` tilda methods; `cs.loadInt(32)` modifies a slice and returns an integer; `b.storeInt(x, 32)` modifies a builder; `b = b.storeInt(x, 32)` also works since it not only modifies but returns; chained methods work identically to JS, they return `self`; everything works exactly as expected, similar to JS; no runtime overhead, exactly same Fift instructions; custom methods are created with ease; tilda `~` does not exist in Tolk at all; [more details here](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/tolk/tolk-vs-func/mutability)
10. Clear and readable error messages on type mismatch
11. `bool` type support
12. Indexed access `tensorVar.0` and `tupleVar.0` is supported
13. Nullable types `T?`, null safety, smart casts, operator `!`
14. Union types and pattern matching (for types and for expressions, switch-like behavior)
15. Type aliases are supported
16. Structures are supported
17. Generics are supported
18. Methods (as extension functions) are supported
19. Trailing comma is supported
20. Semicolon after the last statement in a block is optional
21. Fift output contains the original `.tolk` lines as comments
22. [Auto-packing](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/tolk/tolk-vs-func/pack-to-from-cells) to/from cells — for any types
23. [Universal createMessage](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/tolk/tolk-vs-func/create-message) to avoid manual cells composition
24. Auto-detect and inline functions at the compiler level
25. Various optimizations for gas efficiency

### Tooling around

- [JetBrains IDE plugin](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/intellij-ton)
- [VS Code extension](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton-language-server)
- [FunC-to-Tolk converter](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/convert-func-to-tolk)
- [tolk-js](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/tolk-js) WASM wrapper for the Tolk compiler, integrated into Blueprint


### Tolk vs FunC gas benchmarks

The [Tolk-bench repository](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/tolk-bench) contains several contracts migrated from FunC to Tolk, preserving all logic and passing the same tests.

As you see, not only does the code become readable, but gas usage is noticeably reduced. And there are no tricks here—just clean, consistent logic—whether it's a Jetton or a Wallet.

The rule is simple: **if you write code the way the language encourages — gas will take care of itself**.
