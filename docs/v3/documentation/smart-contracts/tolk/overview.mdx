# Tolk language: overview

**Tolk** is a next-generation language for smart contracts in TON.
It replaces FunC with modern syntax, strong types, and built-in serialization — while generating even more efficient assembler code.

```tolk
import "utils"

struct Storage {
    counter: int32
}

fun Storage.load() {
    return Storage.fromCell(contract.getData());
}

fun onInternalMessage(in: InMessage) {
    ...
}

get fun currentCounter(): int {
    val storage = lazy Storage.load();
    return storage.counter;
}
```

<details>
  <summary><b>See same logic implemented with FunC</b></summary>

```func
#include "utils.fc";

global int ctx_counter;

int load_data() impure {
  slice cs = get_data().begin_parse();
  ctx_counter = cs~load_uint(32);
}

() recv_internal(int msg_value, cell msg_full, slice msg_body) impure {
  slice cs = msg_full.begin_parse();
  int flags = cs.load_uint(4);
  if (flags & 1) {
    return ();
  }
  ...
}

int currentCounter() method_id {
  load_data(); ;; fills global variables
  return ctx_counter;
}
```

## Migrating from FunC to Tolk

If you are familiar with FunC and want to explore Tolk, here's your path:

1. Create a fresh "Tolk counter" project: `npm create ton@latest`. You'll notice how different the code feels: structures, unions, matching, toCell(), etc.
2. Explore the [Tolk vs FunC benchmarks](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/tolk-bench). These are real-world contracts (Jetton, NFT, Wallet, etc.) migrated from FunC — same logic, but written in a cleaner, more expressive style.
3. Read the guide [Tolk vs FunC: in short](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/tolk/tolk-vs-func/in-short). It highlights syntax differences — but remember, Tolk is more than just syntax. It encourages a shift in mindset toward data-driven, declarative logic.
4. Try a [FunC-to-Tolk converter](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/convert-func-to-tolk). It's a great starting point for incremental migration.

## How to try Tolk if you don't know FunC

Since Tolk has just been released, it lacks full-fledged documentation.

If you are new to TON, your way is:

1. Dig into [this documentation](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/overview) to acquire basic development in TON. Get familiar with cells and TON asynchronous nature.
2. Create a "Tolk counter" with blueprint: `npm create ton@latest`. Ensure it works.
3. Continue reading documentation and doing some experience. Facing FunC/Tact snippets, keep in mind that being expressed with Tolk, they would look nicer.

In the upcoming months, the whole TON documentation will be adapted to onboard newcomers onto Tolk instead of FunC.

## Tooling around Tolk

Tolk is supported across the ecosystem:

1. [JetBrains IDE plugin](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/intellij-ton) supports Tolk, FunC, Fift, and TL/B
2. [VS Code Extension](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton-language-server) with Tolk support
3. [Language server](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton-language-server) for any LSP-compatible editor
4. [FunC-to-Tolk converter](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/convert-func-to-tolk) — migrate a whole project with a single `npx` command
5. [tolk-js](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/tolk-js) — WASM wrapper for Tolk compiler, integrated into blueprint

The Tolk compiler itself is part of the `ton-blockchain` [repository](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton).

## Is Tolk production-ready?

All contracts in the [Tolk vs FunC benchmarks](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/tolk-bench)
pass the same test suites as their FunC counterparts — with identical logic and behavior.

Yes, the compiler is new, and some edge cases might still appear.
But Tolk is already a **production-ready replacement for FunC** — and ready for real-world usage.

(And regardless of the language, well-tested code is the key to reliable smart contracts.)
