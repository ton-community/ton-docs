# Tolk language overview

**Tolk** is a next-generation language for developing smart contracts on TON. It replaces FunC with an expressive syntax, a robust type system, and built-in serialization — while generating highly optimized assembly code.

This page introduces Tolk’s _core features, explains how it compares to FunC, and outlines how to get started with the language_ — whether you’re migrating from FunC or writing smart contracts from scratch.

## Why choose Tolk

1. Clean, expressive syntax inspired by TypeScript and Rust.
2. Built-in primitives for TON, including _auto-serialized structs, pattern matching, and first-class message handling_.
3. Strong static type system with _null safety, type aliases, union types, and generics_ for safer, clearer code.
4. Gas-efficient by design — contracts can cost up to **50% less** than FunC equivalents thanks to compiler optimizations and **[lazy](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/tolk/tolk-vs-func/lazy-loading)** functionality.
5. Low-level control is available when needed, with direct access to the TVM stack and instructions.

## Getting started with Tolk

If you're starting with Tolk, follow these steps:

1. Explore the [TON smart contract documentation](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/overview) to learn the fundamentals.
2. [Set up](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/tolk/environment-setup.mdx) the first Tolk counter project using
`npm create ton@latest`.
3. Follow the [step-by-step guide](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/tolk/counter-smart-contract.mdx) to build a counter contract.
4. Read the [Tolk language guide](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/tolk/language-guide.mdx) for a high-level overview of the language.
5. Continue exploring the documentation. When you come across FunC or Tact code, compare it to its Tolk equivalent — you’ll often find it’s cleaner and more declarative.

The TON documentation will continue evolving to support Tolk as the primary smart contract language.

## How to migrate from FunC

If you’ve written contracts in FunC, migrating to Tolk is straightforward — and often results in simpler, more maintainable code.

1. Try building a basic contract in Tolk — for example, a counter using `npm create ton@latest`. You’ll quickly notice the shift from stack logic to expressive constructs with structured types, unions, pattern matching, `toCell()`, and more.
2. Explore the [Tolk vs FunC benchmarks](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/tolk-bench). These are real-world contracts (Jetton, NFT, Wallet, etc.) migrated from FunC — same logic, but expressed in a cleaner, more expressive style.
3. Read [Tolk vs FunC: in short](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/tolk/tolk-vs-func/in-short) for a quick comparison of syntax and concepts.
4. Use the [FunC-to-Tolk converter](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/convert-func-to-tolk) to migrate existing codebases incrementally.

#### Example of a basic Tolk smart contract:

```text
import "utils"

struct Storage {
    counter: int32
}

fun Storage.load() {
    return Storage.fromCell(contract.getData());
}

fun onInternalMessage(in: InMessage) {
    // ...
}

get fun currentCounter(): int {
    val storage = lazy Storage.load();
    return storage.counter;
}
```

<details>
  <summary><b>Equivalent implementation in FunC</b></summary>

  ```text
  #include "utils.fc";

  global int ctx_counter;

  int load_data() impure {
    slice cs = get_data().begin_parse();
    ctx_counter = cs~load_uint(32);
  }

  () recv_internal(int msg_value, cell msg_full, slice msg_body) impure {
    slice cs = msg_full.begin_parse();
    int flags = cs~load_uint(4);
    if (flags & 1) {
      return ();
    }
    ...
  }

  int currentCounter() method_id {
    load_data(); ;; fills global variables
    return ctx_counter;
  }
  ```

The Tolk compiler itself lives in the `ton` [repository](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton).


## Is Tolk production-ready?

All contracts in the [Tolk vs FunC benchmarks](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/tolk-bench) pass the same test suites as their FunC counterparts — with identical logic and behavior.

The compiler is new, so some edge cases may still occur. However, Tolk already serves as a **production-ready replacement for FunC**, suitable for real-world use.

Regardless of the language, well-tested code is the key to building reliable smart contracts.
