# Overview

Fift is a stack-based language specifically designed for developing, debugging, and managing TON Blockchain smart contracts.

Here is a simple Hello World example written in Fift:
```fift
{ ."hello " } execute ."world"
hello world ok
```

While most smart contract development cases don't require Fift, it becomes essential for:
- Solving unique technical challenges
- Low-level TVM interactions
- Advanced contract debugging
