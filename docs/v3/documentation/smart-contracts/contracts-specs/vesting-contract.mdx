# Vesting contract

The vesting contract is a smart contract implementation on the TON blockchain, enabling secure, scheduled distribution of Toncoin assets. This contract provides a robust framework for token management, ensuring the controlled release of funds based on predetermined schedules and conditions.

## Core functionality

The contract is a secure escrow service that locks a specified amount of Toncoin for a defined period and gradually releases it according to configurable parameters. This mechanism ensures predictable token distribution while maintaining strict control over asset release schedules.

## Contract parameters

During deployment, the system establishes the following parameters, which cannot be changed and remain fixed throughout the entire duration of the contract:

| Parameter                | Description                                     | Example values       |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `vesting_total_amount`   | Total locked Toncoins (in nanotons)             | 500 TON              |
| `vesting_start_time`     | Unix timestamp marking vesting period beginning | Current time + delay |
| `vesting_total_duration` | Total vesting period duration (seconds)         | 31104000 (one year)  |
| `unlock_period`          | Time interval between releases (seconds)        | 2592000 (monthly)    |
| `cliff_duration`         | Initial lock period before first release        | 5184000 (two months) |
| `vesting_sender_address` | Authorized address for locked funds management  | Configurable         |
| `owner_address`          | Beneficiary address for Toncoin distribution    | Configurable         |

You can acquire these specific parameters using the `get_vesting_data()` method.

The parameters must satisfy these conditions:

```
vesting_total_duration > 0
vesting_total_duration <= 135 years (2^32 seconds)
unlock_period > 0
unlock_period <= vesting_total_duration
cliff_duration >= 0
cliff_duration < vesting_total_duration
vesting_total_duration mod unlock_period == 0
cliff_duration mod unlock_period == 0
```

Before sending Toncoins to the deployed smart contract, users can verify parameter compliance using the get method, even though the contract itself does not perform these checks.

## Lock mechanism

Before `vesting_start_time`, the contract locks the entire `vesting_total_amount`.

Starting at `vesting_start_time`, it unlocks the amount proportionately. For example, if the `vesting_total_duration` is 10 months, the `unlock_period` is 1 month, and the `vesting_total_amount` is 500 TON, then the contract unlocks 50 TON (500 \* 10/100) each month, fully releasing all 500 TON in 10 months.

If a cliff period exists, no amount unlocks during that time. Once the cliff period ends, the contract unlocking according to the same formula. For instance, with a `cliff_period` of 3 months, the contract unlocks nothing in the first 3 months, then unlocks 150 TON at once, followed by 50 TON each month thereafter.

You can use the `get_locked_amount(int at_time)` method to calculate how much will be locked at a specific time. The contract allows you to transfer locked Toncoins only to whitelisted addresses or the `vesting_sender_address`. Once unlocked, you can freely send the Toncoins wherever you like.

## Whitelist

A whitelist contains addresses to which you can send Toncoins, even if the coins remain locked.

The `get_whitelist()` method retrieves all whitelist addresses as a list of (wc, hash_part) tuples. You can use the `is_whitelisted(slice address)` method to check if a specific address is on the whitelist.

The `vesting_sender_address` can add new addresses to the whitelist at any time using the `op::add_whitelist` message, but no addresses can be removed from the whitelist. You can always send locked coins to the `vesting_sender_address` without adding it to the whitelist.

## Top-up

You can send Toncoins to the vesting contract from any address.

## Wallet smart contract

This [contract](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/vesting-contract/blob/2a63cb96942332abf92ed8425b37645fe4f41f86/contracts/vesting_wallet.fc#L366) is similar to the [standard wallet V3 smart contract](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/master/crypto/smartcont/wallet3-code.fc).

The contract maintains `seqno`, `subwallet_id`, and `public_key`, accepts external messages in the same format, and offers get-methods `seqno()`, `get_subwallet_id()`, and `get_public_key()`. Unlike standard wallets, this vesting contract restricts sending to one message at a time.

## Send

The public key owner can initiate the sending of Toncoins from the vesting contract by an external message, just like in standard wallets.

The owner initiates Toncoin transfers by sending an `op::send` internal message from their owner address. In typical usage, the same user owns both the public key and the `owner address`.

## Whitelist restrictions

The contract restricts messages sent to the `vesting_sender_address` by allowing only `send_mode == 3`.

Users typically add addresses to the whitelist to enable validation using locked coins or staking locked coins in pools.

Whitelisted addresses must adhere to these restrictions to prevent Toncoin theft:

- Only `send_mode == 3` is permitted
- Messages must be bounceable
- No `state_init` attachments are allowed

System elector addresses accept only these operations:

- `op::elector_new_stake`
- `op::elector_recover_stake`
- `op::vote_for_complaint`
- `op::vote_for_proposal`

System config addresses accept only:

- `op::vote_for_proposal`

Other whitelisted destinations permit:

- Empty messages and empty text messages
- Text messages starting with "d," "w," "D," or "W"
- Specific operations:
  - `op::single_nominator_pool_withdraw`
  - `op::single_nominator_pool_change_validator`
  - `op::ton_stakers_deposit`
  - `op::jetton_burn`
  - `op::ton_stakers_vote`
  - `op::vote_for_proposal`
  - `op::vote_for_complaint`

Addresses outside the whitelist operate without restrictions. Unlocked Toncoins remain unrestricted regardless of destination, including whitelisted addresses and `vesting_sender_address`.

## Project structure

- `contracts` - source code of all the smart contracts of the project and their dependencies.
- `wrappers` - wrapper classes (implementing `Contract` from ton-core) for the contracts, including any [de]serialization primitives and compilation functions.
- `tests` - tests for the contracts.
- `scripts` - scripts used by the project, mainly the deployment scripts.

## How to use

### Build

```bash
npx blueprint build` or `yarn blueprint build`
```

### Test

```bash
npx blueprint test` or `yarn blueprint test`
```

### Deploy or run another script

```bash
npx blueprint run` or `yarn blueprint run`
```

### Add a new contract
