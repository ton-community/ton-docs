# Precompiled contracts

A _precompiled smart contract_ is a contract with a C++ implementation in the node. When a validator processes a transaction for such a contract, it can execute this native implementation instead of TVM. This improves performance and reduces computation fees.

## Config

The list of precompiled contracts is stored in the MasterChain configuration:

```tlb
precompiled_smc#b0 gas_usage:uint64 = PrecompiledSmc;
precompiled_contracts_config#c0 list:(HashmapE 256 PrecompiledSmc) = PrecompiledContractsConfig;
_ PrecompiledContractsConfig = ConfigParam 45;
```

The `list:(HashmapE 256 PrecompiledSmc)` represents a mapping of `(code_hash -> precompiled_smc)`. A contract is considered _precompiled_ if its code hash exists in this map.

## Contract execution

Transactions for precompiled smart contracts (those with code hashes in `ConfigParam 45`) follow this execution flow:

1. Retrieve the `gas_usage` value from the masterchain config
2. If the contract balance cannot cover the `gas_usage` cost, the compute phase fails with [`cskip_no_gas`](/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-overview#when-the-compute-phase-is-skipped)
3. Execution proceeds via one of two paths:
   - **TVM execution**: Used if precompiled execution is disabled or the C++ implementation is unavailable in the node version. TVM executes with the gas limits defined by the network configuration (see [gas and fee parameters](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/limits#gas-and-fee-parameters) and [Param20/Param21](/v3/documentation/network/configs/blockchain-configs#param-20-and-21)).
   - **Native execution**: Used when precompiled implementation is both enabled and available, executing the C++ code directly
4. Compute phase values are overridden:
   - `gas_used` set to `gas_usage`
   - `vm_steps`, `vm_init_state_hash`, and `vm_final_state_hash` set to zero
5. Computation fees are calculated based on `gas_usage` rather than actual TVM gas consumption

For precompiled contracts, the 17th element of `c7` (index `16`) holds the precompiled `gas_usage` value for the current contract as defined in `ConfigParam 45`; see [c7](/v3/documentation/tvm/changelog/tvm-upgrade-2024-04#c7). The `GETPRECOMPILEDGAS` opcode is currently reserved and returns `null`; when activated, it will return the precompiled contract gas usage; see [new opcodes](/v3/documentation/tvm/changelog/tvm-upgrade-2024-04#new-opcodes). Non-precompiled contracts return `null` for this value.

**Note**: Enable precompiled contract execution by running `validator-engine` with the [`--enable-precompiled-smc`](/v3/documentation/infra/nodes/node-commands) (experimental) flag. Both execution methods produce identical transactions, allowing validators with and without C++ implementations to coexist in the network. This enables gradual adoption when adding new entries to `ConfigParam 45`.
