# Infinity Sharding Paradigm


## Understanding split merge in TON Blockchain
The TON (The Open Network) blockchain introduces innovative mechanisms for scalability and efficiency. One of the key features is **split-merge**, a fundamental component of its architecture. This article outlines the core principles of split-merge within the Infinite Sharding Paradigm (ISP) framework.

#### ISP and its application
At the heart of TON's design is the ISP, which treats each account as its own **AccountChain**—a unique chain of transactions associated with a single account. These AccountChains are grouped into ShardChain blocks to improve processing efficiency. The state of a ShardChain is derived from the combined states of all the AccountChains it contains. As a result, a ShardChain block can be viewed as a collection of virtual blocks corresponding to individual accounts.

- **ShardState**: approximated as `Hashmap(n, AccountState)`, where `n` is the bit length of the `account_id`.
- **ShardBlock**: approximated as `Hashmap(n, AccountBlock)`.

Each ShardChain block is uniquely identified by a combination consisting of the `workchain_id` and a binary prefix `s` of the `account_id`.

## Algorithm for deciding whether to split or merge
The decision to split or merge shards proceeds as follows:
1. Each block is evaluated using key metrics, such as block size, gas consumption, and logical time (LT) delta.
2. These metrics are used to determine whether the block is **overloaded** or **underloaded**.
3. Each shard maintains a history of overload and underload events. Based on recent trends, it sets `want_split` or `want_merge` flags.
4. Validators make split or merge decisions using these flags by configuration parameters.

### 1. Evaluating the current block state
Each block includes three core parameters that are used to assess load:
1. **Block size estimate:** an estimated value computed during block collation (not the actual block size).
2. **Gas consumption:** total gas consumed by all transactions in the block, excluding ticktock, mint, and recover transactions.
3. **LT delta:** the difference between the block's starting and ending logical times.

### 2. Block limits and classification

Limits for these metrics are defined in [configuration parameters 22 and 23](/v3/documentation/network/configs/blockchain-configs#param-22-and-23).
Each parameter has three thresholds: **underload**, **soft**, and **hard**:

#### Threshold table

| **Parameter**     | **Underload / Soft / Hard (BaseChain)** | **Underload / Soft / Hard (MasterChain)** |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Block size        | 128 / 256 / 512 KiB                     | N/A                                       |
| Gas consumption   | 2M / 10M / 20M                          | 200K / 1M / 2.5M                           |
| LT delta          | 1000 / 5000 / 10000                     | Same as BaseChain                         |

A **medium limit** is also defined as `(soft + hard) / 2`.

Each parameter is classified as follows:
- `0` - underload limit is not reached.
- `1` - underload limit is exceeded.
- `2` - soft limit is exceeded.
- `3` - medium limit is exceeded.
- `4` - hard limit is exceeded.

The block classification is the maximum of the three individual classifications (`Classification of size`, `Classification of gas`, `Classification of lt delta`).

Example: size = 2, gas = 3, lt = 1 → block classification = 3.

Based on classification:
- 0 (Underload): merge candidate.
- 2 (Soft): internal messages are no longer processed; candidate for split.
- 3 (Medium): external messages are skipped.

### 3. Overload and underload determination

Additional heuristics are applied beyond classification based on the message queue status:

* A block is **overloaded** if:
  * Classification ≥ `2` (soft) and message queue size ≤ `SPLIT_MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 100000`
  * Dispatch queue limit is reached, and message queue size ≤ `SPLIT_MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 100000`
  * Message queue size is  ≥ `FORCE_SPLIT_QUEUE_SIZE = 4096`, and ≤ `SPLIT_MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 100000`
* A block is **underloaded** if:
  * Classification = `0` (underload) and message queue size ≤ `MERGE_MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 2047`


### 4. Deciding whether to split or merge

Each block maintains a history of underload and overload conditions — represented as a 64-bit mask tracking the status of the last 64 blocks. This mask is used to determine whether a shard should split or merge.

The underload and overload histories are evaluated using a weighted formula:

`one_bits(mask & 0xffff) * 3 + one_bits(mask & 0xffff0000) * 2 + one_bits(mask & 0xffff00000000) - (3 + 2 + 1) * 16 * 2 / 3`

Here, `one_bits` counts the number of `1`-bits in the mask. Lower-order bits correspond to the most recent blocks.

The respective `want_merge` or `want_split` flag is set if the computed weight is non-negative.

### 5. Final decision

Validators decide to split or merge shards using `want_split` and `want_merge` flags and [workchain configuration parameters](/v3/documentation/network/configs/blockchain-configs#param-12).

Validators determine whether to split or merge shards based on the `want_split` and `want_merge` flags, along with [WorkChain configuration parameters](/v3/documentation/network/configs/blockchain-configs#param-12):

- If a shard's depth is less than `min_split`, it will split.
- If a shard's depth exceeds `max_split`, it will merge.
- Shards at `min_split` depth cannot merge; shards at `max_split` depth cannot split.
- If the block has the `want_split` flag, the shard will split.
- The shards will merge if both the block and its sibling have the `want_merge` flag.

Shards perform the split or merge after a delay of `split_merge_delay = 100` seconds from the decision.


## Messages and instant hypercube routing (instant hypercube routing)

In the infinite sharding paradigm, each account or smart contract is treated as if it were a part of its own ShardChain.
Interactions between accounts occur exclusively through message passing, following the **actor model**, where accounts act as actors.
An efficient messaging system between ShardChains is essential for the operation of the TON blockchain. A key feature supporting this is **Instant Hypercube Routing**, which enables near-instantaneous message delivery and processing across ShardChains. Messages created in one ShardChain block are processed in the next block of the target ShardChain — regardless of how many messages are in the system.

## Sharding example

![](/img/docs/blockchain-fundamentals/shardchains.png)

In the diagram above:
- The shards of a WorkChain are shown over time and separated by dashed lines.
- Blocks 222, 223, and 224 correspond to MasterChain block `seqno = 102`. Block 222 belongs to one shard, while blocks 223 and 224 belong to another.
- If a split or merge event occurs, the affected shards pause operations until the next MasterChain block is produced.

In summary, **split-merge** in the TON blockchain is a sophisticated yet efficient mechanism that enhances scalability and inter-shard communication. It exemplifies TON's approach to solving core blockchain challenges by prioritizing efficiency and global consistency.


## Sharding details

#### Split and non-split parts of shardchain

A ShardChain block and its corresponding state are divided into two components:
1. **Split part:** conforms to the ISP (Independent State Part) form and contains account-specific data.
2. **Non-split part:** contains data related to interactions with other blocks and external systems.


#### Interaction with other blocks

The non-split parts are vital in maintaining global consistency across the network. They address both internal and external local consistency conditions and are responsible for:

- Forwarding messages between ShardChains
- Facilitating cross-shard transactions
- Guaranteeing delivery and verifying a block's initial state against its predecessor

#### Inbound and outbound messages

Key components of the non-split part include:
- **InMsgDescr**: describes all messages imported into the block. These messages are either:
  - processed by a block or transit transaction, i.e., temporarily forwarded as per `Hypercube Routing`.
- **OutMsgDescr**: describes all messages exported or generated by the block. These may be:
  - newly generated messages from a transaction in the block or
  - transit messages are forwarded to a destination outside the current ShardChain forwarded from `InMsgDescr`.

#### Block header and validator signatures

The block header, part of the non-split section, includes metadata such as:
- `workchain_id`
- Binary prefix of `account_ids`
- Block sequence number. The smallest non-negative integer greater than its predecessors' sequence numbers.
- Logical time and UNIX time of generation
- Hashes of:
  - The block's predecessor(s) (two, in the case of a merge)
  - The block's initial and final states
  - The latest known MasterChain block at the time of block generation

After the block is created, validator signatures are appended to produce a signed block.


#### Outbound message queue

The `OutMsgQueue` is another crucial non-split component of the ShardChain state. It holds undelivered outbound messages, as recorded in `OutMsgDescr`, from either the latest block or one of its predecessors.
Each outgoing message is initially placed in `OutMsgQueue`, which remains until it is successfully delivered to its target.

#### Shard split and merge mechanics

Shard configurations can change over time due to split or merge events in dynamic sharding. These changes are coordinated via the MasterChain.
When a split or merge is triggered, the affected shards pause and wait for the next MasterChain block before resuming activity.
