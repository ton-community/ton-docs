# Infinite Sharding Paradigm

## Understanding split-merge in TON Blockchain

The TON (The Open Network) blockchain introduces innovative mechanisms for scalability and efficiency. One of the key features is **split-merge**, a fundamental component of its architecture. This article outlines the core principles of split-merge within the Infinite Sharding Paradigm (ISP) framework.

#### ISP and its application

At the heart of TON's design is the ISP, which treats each account as its own **AccountChain**—a unique chain of transactions associated with a single account. These AccountChains are grouped into ShardChain blocks to improve processing efficiency. The state of a ShardChain is derived from the combined states of all the AccountChains it contains. As a result, a ShardChain block can be viewed as a collection of virtual blocks corresponding to individual accounts.

- **ShardState**: approximated as `Hashmap(n, AccountState)`, where `n` is the bit length of the `account_id`.
- **ShardBlock**: approximated as `Hashmap(n, AccountBlock)`.

Each ShardChain block is uniquely identified by a combination consisting of the `workchain_id` and a binary prefix `s` of the `account_id`.


## Algorithm for deciding whether to split or merge

The decision to split or merge shards proceeds as follows:

1. Each block is evaluated using key metrics, such as block size, gas consumption, and logical time (LT) delta.
2. These metrics are used to determine whether the block is **overloaded** or **underloaded**.
3. Each shard maintains a history of overload and underload events. Based on recent trends, it sets `want_split` or `want_merge` flags.
4. Validators make split or merge decisions using these flags and configuration parameters.

### 1. Evaluating the current block state

Each block includes three core parameters that are used to assess load:

1. **Block size estimate:** an estimated value computed during block collation (not the actual block size).
2. **Gas consumption:** total gas consumed by all transactions in the block, excluding ticktock, mint, and recover transactions.
3. **lt delta:** the difference between the block's starting and ending logical times.

### 2. Block limits and classification

Limits for these metrics are defined in [configuration parameters 22 and 23](/v3/documentation/network/config-params/overview#param-22-and-23).
Each parameter has three thresholds: **underload**, **soft**, and **hard**:

#### Threshold table

| **Parameter**   | **Underload / Soft / Hard (BaseChain)** | **Underload / Soft / Hard (MasterChain)** |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Block size      | 128 / 256 / 512 KiB (illustrative)      | N/A                                       |
| Gas consumption | 2M / 10M / 20M (illustrative)           | 200K / 1M / 2.5M (illustrative)           |
| lt delta        | 1000 / 5000 / 10000 (illustrative)      | Same as BaseChain                         |

:::note
All values are illustrative only. The thresholds are defined by [configuration parameters 22 and 23](/v3/documentation/network/config-params/overview#param-22-and-23) and the live network configuration.
:::
A **medium limit** is also defined as `(soft + hard) / 2`.

Each parameter is classified as follows:

- `0` - underload limit is not reached.
- `1` - underload limit is exceeded.
- `2` - soft limit is exceeded.
- `3` - medium limit is exceeded.
- `4` - hard limit is exceeded.

The block classification is the maximum of the three individual classifications (`Classification of size`, `Classification of gas`, `Classification of lt delta`).

Example: size = 2, gas = 3, lt = 1 → block classification = 3.

Based on classification:

- 0 (Underload): merge candidate.
- 2 (Soft): internal messages are no longer processed; candidate for split.
- 3 (Medium): external messages are skipped.

### 3. Overload and underload determination

Additional heuristics are applied beyond classification based on the message queue status:

- A block is **overloaded** if:
  - Classification ≥ `2` (soft) and message queue size ≤ e.g., `SPLIT_MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 100000`
  - Message dispatch queue limit is reached, and message queue size ≤ e.g., `SPLIT_MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 100000`
  - Message queue size is ≥ e.g., `FORCE_SPLIT_QUEUE_SIZE = 4096`, and ≤ e.g., `SPLIT_MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 100000`
- A block is **underloaded** if:
  - Classification = `0` (underload) and message queue size ≤ e.g., `MERGE_MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 2047`

### 4. Deciding whether to split or merge

Each block maintains a history of underload and overload conditions — represented as a 64-bit mask tracking the status of the last 64 blocks. This mask is used to determine whether a shard should split or merge.

For example, the underload and overload histories may be evaluated using a weighted formula over recent bit windows:

`one_bits(mask & 0xffff) * 3 + one_bits(mask & 0xffff0000) * 2 + one_bits(mask & 0xffff00000000) - (3 + 2 + 1) * 16 * 2 / 3`

Here, `one_bits` counts the number of `1`-bits in the mask. Lower-order bits correspond to the most recent blocks. The respective `want_merge` or `want_split` flag is set if the computed weight is non-negative.

### 5. Final decision

Validators determine whether to split or merge shards based on the `want_split` and `want_merge` flags, along with [WorkChain configuration parameters](/v3/documentation/network/config-params/overview#param-12):

- If a shard's depth is less than `min_split`, it will split.
- If a shard's depth exceeds `max_split`, it will merge.
- Shards at `min_split` depth cannot merge; shards at `max_split` depth cannot split.
- If the block has the `want_split` flag, the shard will split.
- The shards will merge if both the block and its sibling have the `want_merge` flag.

Shards perform the split or merge after a protocol-defined delay from the decision.

## Messages and Instant Hypercube Routing (IHR)

In Infinite Sharding Paradigm, each account or smart contract is treated as if it were a part of its own ShardChain.
Interactions between accounts occur exclusively through message passing, following the **actor model**, where accounts act as actors.
An efficient messaging system between ShardChains is essential for the operation of the TON blockchain. A proposed mechanism called **Instant Hypercube Routing** would enable direct message delivery across ShardChains without intermediate hops. For related fee parameters, see [configuration parameters 24 and 25](/v3/documentation/network/config-params/overview#param-24-and-25).

### Current Status of IHR

:::info Important Clarification
**Instant Hypercube Routing (IHR) is an alternative mechanism for message delivery without intermediate hops.** However, it is important to understand that:

- **IHR is not implemented** and is not yet fully specified
- **IHR is only relevant** when there are more than 16 shards and not all shards are neighbors to each other
- **Current network settings forbid splitting deeper than 16 shards**, so IHR is not relevant in any practical sense today

Currently, TON uses standard **Hypercube Routing (HR)** for message delivery between shards, which routes messages through intermediate shards when necessary. IHR would provide a more direct routing mechanism, but only becomes necessary in much larger shard configurations than are currently possible.

### Message Routing Mechanisms

TON Blockchain supports two conceptual message routing mechanisms:

1. **Hypercube Routing (HR)** - Currently implemented mechanism that routes messages between shards through intermediate hops when necessary
2. **Instant Hypercube Routing (IHR)** - Alternative mechanism (not implemented) that would allow direct message delivery without intermediate hops

The choice between these mechanisms would depend on the network topology and shard configuration, but given current limitations on shard depth, only HR is relevant.

## Sharding example

![Shard splitting and merging over time](/img/docs/blockchain-fundamentals/shardchains.png)

In the diagram above:

- The shards of a WorkChain are shown over time and separated by dashed lines.
- For illustration, blocks 222, 223, and 224 correspond to MasterChain block `seqno = 102`. Block 222 belongs to one shard, while blocks 223 and 224 belong to another.
- If a split or merge event occurs, the affected shards pause operations until the next MasterChain block is produced.

In summary, **split-merge** in TON Blockchain is a sophisticated yet efficient mechanism that enhances scalability and inter-shard communication. It exemplifies TON's approach to solving core blockchain challenges by prioritizing efficiency and global consistency.

## Sharding details

#### Split and non-split parts of ShardChain

A ShardChain block and its corresponding state are divided into two components:

1. **Split part:** conforms to the ISP form and contains account-specific data.
2. **Non-split part:** contains data related to interactions with other blocks and external systems.

#### Interaction with other blocks

The non-split parts are vital in maintaining global consistency across the network. They address both internal and external local consistency conditions and are responsible for:

- Forwarding messages between ShardChains
- Facilitating cross-shard transactions
- Guaranteeing delivery and verifying a block's initial state against its predecessor

#### Inbound and outbound messages

Key components of the non-split part include:

- **InMsgDescr**: describes all messages imported into the block. These messages are either:
  - processed by a transaction in the block or forwarded in transit per Hypercube Routing.
- **OutMsgDescr**: describes all messages exported or generated by the block. These may be:
  - newly generated messages from transactions in the block or
  - transit messages forwarded outside the current ShardChain (forwarded from InMsgDescr).

#### Block header and validator signatures

The block header, part of the non-split section, includes metadata such as:

- `workchain_id`
- Shard prefix (binary prefix over `account_id` values for the shard)
- Block sequence number: the smallest non-negative integer greater than its predecessors' sequence numbers.
- Logical time and UNIX time of generation
- Hashes of:
  - The block's predecessor(s) (two, in the case of a merge)
  - The block's initial and final states
  - The latest known MasterChain block at the time of block generation

After the block is created, validator signatures are appended to produce a signed block.

#### Outbound message queue

The out_msg_queue_info is another crucial non-split component of the ShardChain state. It holds undelivered outbound messages, as recorded in OutMsgDescr, from either the latest block or one of its predecessors.
Each outgoing message is initially placed in the outbound queue, where it remains until successfully delivered to its target.

#### Shard split and merge mechanics

Shard configurations can change over time due to split or merge events in dynamic sharding. These changes are coordinated via the MasterChain.
When a split or merge is triggered, the affected shards pause and wait for the next MasterChain block before resuming activity.
