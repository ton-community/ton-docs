# Smart contract addresses

Every interaction on the TON Blockchain happens between smart contracts, each identified by a unique address. This section explains how these addresses are structured and why they're fundamental to TON's architecture.

## Everything is a smart contract

TON implements the [Actor model](/v3/concepts/dive-into-ton/ton-blockchain/blockchain-of-blockchains#single-actor), where all entities - including wallets - are smart contracts. Each actor:

- Processes incoming messages
- Updates its internal state
- Generates outgoing messages

This design requires every actor to have a unique address for message routing.

:::info For Ethereum developers
Unlike EVM where addresses and contracts are separate, TON unifies them - every address points to a contract.

## Address of smart contract

Smart contract addresses on TON typically consist of two main components:

- **(workchain_id)**: the workchain ID (a signed 32-bit integer)

- **(account_id)**: the address of the account (64-512 bits, depending on the workchain)

### WorkChain ID and Account ID

#### Workchain ID

[As explained earlier](/v3/concepts/dive-into-ton/ton-blockchain/blockchain-of-blockchains#workchain-blockchain-with-your-own-rules), the TON Blockchain supports up to `2^32` unique workchains, each with its own rules. The 32-bit `workchain_id` prefix in smart contract addresses ensures interoperability, allowing contracts to send and receive messages across different workchains.

Currently, only two workchains are active:
- **Masterchain** (`workchain_id = -1`): The central coordinating chain.
- **Basechain** (`workchain_id = 0`): The default workchain for most operations.

Both use **256-bit addresses** for accounts.

#### Account ID

All account IDs on TON use 256-bit addresses on the Masterchain and Basechain (also referred to as the basic workchain).

In fact, an account ID (**account_id**) is defined as the result of applying a hash function (specifically SHA-256) to a smart contract object. Every smart contract operating on the TON Blockchain stores two main components:

1. _Compiled code_. The logic of the smart contract, compiled into bytecode.
2. _Initial data_. The contract's values at the moment it is deployed on-chain.

To derive the contract's address, you calculate the hash of the **(Initial code, Initial data)** pair. We won’t explore how the [TVM](/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-overview) works at this time, but it is important to understand that account IDs on TON follow this formula:

**account_id = hash(initial code, initial data)**

Later in this documentation, we will dive deeper into the technical specifications of the TVM and TL-B scheme. Now that we are familiar with how the **account_id** is generated and how it interacts with smart contract addresses on TON, let’s discuss Raw and User-Friendly addresses.

## Summary

- **Every actor is a smart contract**, each requiring a unique address for message routing.  
- **Address structure**:  
  - `workchain_id` (32-bit): Identifies the workchain. 
  - `account_id` (256-bit): A hash of the contract’s initial code and state.  
- **Current standards**: Only Masterchain and Basechain are active, both using 256-bit ID.  
- **Flexibility**: TON supports up to `2^32` workchains, allowing future chains to customize address lengths (64–512 bits).
