# Participate as a maintainer

The Hacktoberfest event is the best time of year to receive support from the community!

If your repository is relevant to the TON Ecosystem, many contributors will be interested in it. Let's help them dive right into your project!

## Prepare your repository

To handle contributors in the right way, you need to have a repository in good standing.

Follow these best practices to prepare your project for contributions:

1. Add the `hacktoberfest` topic to your repository to opt in to Hacktoberfest and indicate you are looking for contributions.
2. Apply the `hacktoberfest` label to issues you want contributors to help you with in your GitHub or GitLab project.
3. Please read and use [the essential tips for new open source maintainers](https://blog.ton.org/essential-tips-for-new-open-source-maintainers) by TON Society.
4. Prepare to accept legitimate pull requests (GitHub) or merge requests (GitLab) by merging them or leaving an overall approving review.
5. Reject any spam requests you receive by labeling them as `spam`, and close or label any other invalid contributions as `invalid`.

Here is an example of a well-prepared repository: [ton-community/ton-compiler](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-compiler)

After that, feel free to add your repository to the list.
