[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is a month-long celebration of *open-source projects*, their *maintainers*, and the entire community of *contributors*. Each October, open source maintainers give new contributors extra attention as they guide developers through their first pull requests.

For the TON Community it's time to help ecosystem growth together, so let's join the whole world with our **Hack-TON-berfest** party and become *#1 open-source ecosystem of the year*!

## How to Participate?

The Hacktoberfest rules for 2022 are as follows:

* **Hacktoberfest is open to everyone**!
* Register anytime between September 26 and October 31
* Pull requests can be made in any GITHUB or GITLAB project:
  * [List of projects on TON Ecosystem](/hacktonberfest)
  * [List of projects on GitHub](https://github.com/topics/hacktoberfest)
* Have **4** pull/merge requests accepted between October 1 and October 31
* The first 40,000 participants (maintainers and contributors) who complete Hacktoberfest can choose between two prizes: a tree planted in their honor or a Hacktoberfest 2022 t-shirt. _(from the Hacktoberfest community)_
* Every participant (maintainer and contributor) to any of the TON Ecosystem projects will receive a [**Limited Hack-TON-berfest NFT**](/v3/documentation/archive/hacktoberfest-2022#what-are-the-rewards). _(from TON Foundation)_

For everyone in TON it's an opportunity to drive the growth of the entire ecosystem and receive cool rewards from TON Foundation. Let's do it together!

## What are the rewards?

To motivate the community to contribute to open source projects in the TON Ecosystem, you'll be able to receive a special reward from TON Foundation. Every participant will receive a **Limited Hack-TON-berfest NFT** achievement as a proof of participating:
