# Compile and build smart contracts on TON

Here is a list of libraries and repositories to build smart contracts.

**TL;DR:**

In most cases, using Blueprint is sufficient. If you need a more low-level approach, you can use ton-compiler or func-js.

## Blueprint

### Overview

A development environment for the TON Blockchain for writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts. Read more in the [Blueprint repository](https://github.com/ton-org/blueprint).

### Installation

Run the following in the terminal to create a new project and follow the on-screen instructions:

```bash
npm create ton@latest
```



### Features

- Streamlined workflow for building, testing, and deploying smart contracts
- Dead simple deployment to mainnet/testnet using your favorite wallet (e.g., Tonkeeper)
- Blazing-fast testing of multiple smart contracts in an isolated in-process blockchain

### Tech stack

1. Compiling FunC with [func-js](https://github.com/ton-community/func-js) (no CLI required)
2. Testing smart contracts with [Sandbox](https://github.com/ton-org/sandbox)
3. Deploying smart contracts with [TON Connect 2.0](https://github.com/ton-connect), [Tonhub wallet](https://tonhub.com/), or a `ton://` deeplink

### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) with a recent version like v18, verify version with `node -v`
- IDE with TypeScript and FunC support like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [FunC plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tonwhales.func-vscode)

### How to use

- [Watch the DoraHacks presentation with a demo of working with Blueprint.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ROXVM-Fojo)
- Read a detailed explanation in the [Blueprint repository](https://github.com/ton-org/blueprint#create-a-new-project).

## ton-compiler

### Overview

Packaged FunC compiler for TON smart contracts:

- GitHub: [ton-community/ton-compiler](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-compiler)
- NPM: [ton-compiler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ton-compiler)

### Installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm install ton-compiler
```

### Features

- Multiple FunC compiler versions
- Doesn't need to install and compile TON
- Programmatic and CLI interfaces
- Ready to use in unit-testing

### How to use

This package adds the `ton-compiler` binary to your project.

FunC compilation is a multi-stage process. One is compiling FunC to Fift code that is then compiled to a binary representation. The Fift compiler already has `Asm.fif` bundled.

FunC stdlib is bundled but can be disabled at runtime.

#### Console Use

```bash
# Compile to binary form (for contract creation)
ton-compiler --input ./wallet.fc --output ./wallet.cell

# Compile to fift (useful for debugging)
ton-compiler --input ./wallet.fc --output-fift ./wallet.fif

# Compile to binary form and fift
ton-compiler --input ./wallet.fc --output ./wallet.cell --output-fift ./wallet.fif

# Disable stdlib
ton-compiler --no-stdlib --input ./wallet.fc --output ./wallet.cell --output-fift ./wallet.fif

# Pick version
ton-compiler --version "legacy" --input ./wallet.fc --output ./wallet.cell --output-fift ./wallet.fif
```

#### Programmatic Use

```javascript
import { compileContract } from "ton-compiler";
let result = await compileContract({ code: 'source code', stdlib: true, version: 'latest' });
if (result.ok) {
  console.log(result.fift); // Compiled Fift assembler
  console.log(result.cell); // Compiled cell Buffer
} else {
  console.warn(result.logs); // Output logs
}
```

## func-js

### Overview

_Cross-platform_ bindings for TON FunC compiler.

It's more low-level than ton-compiler, so use it only if ton-compiler doesn't work for you.

- GitHub: [ton-community/func-js](https://github.com/ton-community/func-js)
- NPM: [@ton-community/func-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ton-community/func-js)

### Installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @ton-community/func-js
```

### Features

- No need to compile or download FunC binaries
- Works in both Node.js and the web (WASM support required)
- Compiles straight to BOC with code cell
- Assembly is returned for debugging purposes
- Does not depend on the file system

### How to use

Internally, this package uses both the FunC compiler and the Fift interpreter, combined into a single library compiled to WASM.

Simple schema:

```text
(your code) -> WASM(FunC -> Fift -> BOC)
```

Sources for the internal library can be found [here](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/tree/master/crypto/funcfiftlib).

### Usage example

```javascript
import {compileFunc, compilerVersion} from '@ton-community/func-js';
import {Cell} from 'ton';

async function main() {
    // You can get compiler version 
    let version = await compilerVersion();
    
    let result = await compileFunc({
        // Entry points of your project
        entryPoints: ['main.fc'],
        // Sources
        sources: {
            "stdlib.fc": "<stdlibCode>",
            "main.fc": "<contractCode>",
            // Rest of the files which are included in main.fc if some
        }
    });

    if (result.status === 'error') {
        console.error(result.message)
        return;
    }

    // result.codeBoc contains base64 encoded BOC with code cell 
    let codeCell = Cell.fromBoc(Buffer.from(result.codeBoc, "base64"))[0];
    
    // result.fiftCode contains assembly version of your code (for debug purposes)
    console.log(result.fiftCode)
}
```

Note that all FunC source file contents used in your project should be passed to `sources`, including:

- entry points
- stdlib.fc (if you use it)
- all files included in entry points
