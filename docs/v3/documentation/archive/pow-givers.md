# POW Givers

:::warning deprecated

The aim of this text is to describe how to interact with Proof-of-Work Giver smart contracts to obtain Toncoin. We assume familiarity with TON Blockchain Lite Client as explained in `Getting Started`, and with the procedure required to compile the Lite Client and other software. For obtaining the larger amount of Toncoin required for running a validator, we also assume acquaintance with the `Full Node` and `Validator` pages. You will also need a dedicated server powerful enough for running a Full Node in order to obtain the larger amount of Toncoin. Obtaining small amounts of Toncoin does not require a dedicated server and may be done in several minutes on a home computer.

> Note that, at the moment, large resources are required for any mining due to the large number of miners.

## 1. Proof-of-Work Giver smart contracts

In order to prevent a small number of malicious parties from collecting all Toncoin, a special kind of "Proof-of-Work Giver" smart contract has been deployed in the masterchain of the network. The addresses of these smart contacts are:

Small givers (deliver from 10 to 100 Toncoin every several minutes):

* kf-kkdY_B7p-77TLn2hUhM6QidWrrsl8FYWCIvBMpZKprBtN

Large givers (deliver 10,000 Toncoin at least once a day):

> Note that at the current moment all large givers are depleted.

The first ten smart contracts enable a user willing to obtain a small amount of Toncoin to obtain some without spending too much computing power (typically, several minutes of work on a home computer should suffice). The remaining smart contracts are for obtaining larger amounts of Toncoin required for running a validator in the network; typically, a day of work on a dedicated server powerful enough to run a validator should suffice to obtain the necessary amount.

> Note that at the moment, due to a large number of miners, large resources are required for mining small givers.

You should randomly choose one of these "proof-of-work giver" smart contracts (from one of these two lists depending on your purpose) and obtain Toncoin from this smart contract by a procedure similar to mining. Essentially, you have to present an external message containing the proof of work and the address of your wallet to the chosen "proof-of-work giver" smart contract, and then the necessary amount will be sent to you.

## 2. The mining process

In order to create an external message containing the "proof-of-work", you should run a special mining utility, compiled from the TON sources located in the GitHub repository. The utility is located in file `./crypto/pow-miner` with respect to the build directory and can be compiled by typing `make pow-miner` in the build directory.

However, before running `pow-miner`, you need to know the actual values of `seed` and `complexity` parameters of the chosen "proof-of-work giver" smart contract. This can be done by invoking the get-method `get_pow_params` of this smart contract. For instance, if you the use giver smart contract, `kf-kkdY_B7p-77TLn2hUhM6QidWrrsl8FYWCIvBMpZKprBtN` you can simply type:

```
> runmethod kf-kkdY_B7p-77TLn2hUhM6QidWrrsl8FYWCIvBMpZKprBtN get_pow_params
```

in the Lite Client console and obtain an output like:

``` ...
    arguments:  [ 101616 ] 
    result:  [ 229760179690128740373110445116482216837 53919893334301279589334030174039261347274288845081144962207220498432 100000000000 256 ] 
    remote result (not to be trusted):  [ 229760179690128740373110445116482216837 53919893334301279589334030174039261347274288845081144962207220498432 100000000000 256 ]
```

The two first large numbers in the "result:" line are the `seed` and the `complexity` of this smart contract. In this example, the seed is `229760179690128740373110445116482216837`, and the complexity is `53919893334301279589334030174039261347274288845081144962207220498432`.

Next, you invoke the `pow-miner` utility as follows:

```
$ crypto/pow-miner -vv -w<num-threads> -t<timeout-in-sec> <your-wallet-address> <seed> <complexity> <iterations> <pow-giver-address> <boc-filename>
```

Here:
* `<num-threads>` is the number of CPU cores that you want to use for mining.
* `<timeout-in-sec>` is the maximal amount of seconds that the miner would run before admitting failure.
* `<your-wallet-address>` is the address of your wallet (possibly not initialized yet).It is either on the masterchain or on the workchain (note that you need a masterchain wallet to control a validator).
* `<seed>` and `<complexity>` are the most recent values obtained by running get-method `get-pow-params`.
* `<pow-giver-address>` is the address of the chosen proof-of-work giver smart contract.
* `<boc-filename>` is the filename of the output file where the external message with the proof of work will be saved in the case of success.

For example, if your wallet address is `kQBWkNKqzCAwA9vjMwRmg7aY75Rf8lByPA9zKXoqGkHi8SM7`, you might run:

```
$ crypto/pow-miner -vv -w7 -t100 kQBWkNKqzCAwA9vjMwRmg7aY75Rf8lByPA9zKXoqGkHi8SM7 229760179690128740373110445116482216837 53919893334301279589334030174039261347274288845081144962207220498432 100000000000 kf-kkdY_B7p-77TLn2hUhM6QidWrrsl8FYWCIvBMpZKprBtN mined.boc
```

The program will run for some time (at most 100 seconds in this case) and either terminate successfully (with a zero exit code) and save the required proof of work into file `mined.boc` or terminate with a non-zero exit code if no proof of work was found.

In the case of failure, you will see something like:

```
   [ expected required hashes for success: 2147483648 ]
   [ hashes computed: 1192230912 ]
```

and the program will terminate with a non-zero exit code. Then you have to obtain the `seed` and `complexity` again (because they may have changed in the meantime as a result of processing requests from more successful miners) and re-run the `pow-miner` with the new parameters, repeating the process again and again until success.

In the case of success, you will see something like:

```
   [ expected required hashes for success: 2147483648 ]
   4D696E65005EFE49705690D2AACC203003DBE333046683B698EF945FF250723C0F73297A2A1A41E2F1A1F533B3BC4F5664D6C743C1C5C74BB3342F3A7314364B3D0DA698E6C80C1EA4ACDA33755876665780BAE9BE8A4D6385A1F533B3BC4F5664D6C743C1C5C74BB3342F3A7314364B3D0DA698E6C80C1EA4
   Saving 176 bytes of serialized external message into file `mined.boc`
   [ hashes computed: 1122036095 ]
```

Then you can use the Lite Client to send an external message from file `mined.boc` to the proof-of-work giver smart contract (and you must do this as soon as possible):

```
> sendfile mined.boc
... external message status is 1
```

You can wait for several seconds and check the state of your wallet:

```

If nobody has sent a valid proof of work with this `seed` and `complexity` before you, the proof-of-work giver will accept your proof of work, and this will be reflected in the balance of your wallet (10 or 20 seconds may elapse after sending the external message before this happens; be sure to make several attempts and type `last` each time before checking the balance of your wallet to refresh the Lite Client state). In the case of success, you will see that the balance has been increased (and even that your wallet has been created in an uninitialized state if it did not exist before). In the case of failure, you will have to obtain the new `seed` and `complexity` and repeat the mining process from the very beginning.

If you have been lucky and the balance of your wallet has increased, you may want to initialize the wallet if it wasn't initialized before (more information on wallet creation can be found in `Step-by-Step`):

```

Now you are a happy owner of 100 Toncoin. Congratulations!

## 3. Automating the mining process in the case of failure

If you fail to obtain your Toncoin for a long time, this may happen because too many other users are simultaneously mining from the same proof-of-work giver smart contract. Maybe you should choose another proof-of-work giver smart contract from one of the lists given above. Alternatively, you can write a simple script to automatically run `pow-miner` with the correct parameters again and again until success (detected by checking the exit code of `pow-miner`) and invoke the Lite Client with the parameter `-c 'sendfile mined.boc'` to send the external message immediately after it is found.
