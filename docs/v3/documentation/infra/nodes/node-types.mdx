# TON node types

**A blockchain node** is a device, usually a computer, that runs the TON blockchain's software and participates in blockchain operations. In general, nodes ensure the decentralization of the TON network.

Nodes perform different functions within the TON protocol:

- **Full** and **archive nodes** maintain the blockchain block and transaction history, enable users and client applications to look for blocks and transactions, and send new transactions into the blockchain;
- **Validator nodes** verify transactions, ensuring blockchain security.

Below, you find more detailed information about each node type and the interaction of full and archive nodes with client applications.

## Full node

**The full node** is a basic node type within the TON blockchain. It serves as the backbone of the TON blockchain by keeping its block history—in other words, its _current state_.

Compared to **archive nodes**, full nodes keep only the latest part of the blockchain state, which is vital for ensuring client applications' network stability and operation. Full nodes _prune_ the state of the TON blockchain they keep. This means the full node automatically removes earlier blocks that become unnecessary for the network to manage its data volume effectively.

To allow client applications to look for blocks and transactions and send new transactions into the TON blockchain, full nodes are equipped with the liteserver functionality: see [Interacting with TON nodes](#interacting-with-ton-nodes) below.

## Archive node

The archive node is a full node that keeps the entire block history of the TON blockchain. These nodes act as the decentralized point of truth to ensure consistency of the whole blockchain history. They are a backend for blockchain explorers and other applications relying on deep transaction history.

Archive nodes do not prune the blockchain state, elevating system requirements, especially in storage. According to the latest estimations, while full and validator nodes require about 1 TB of disk space, archive nodes need about 12 TB to store the complete block history.

## Validator node

**Validator nodes** or **validators** are the TON network participants who propose new blocks and verify transactions according to the TON's _Proof-of-stake_ mechanism. In this way, validators contribute to the overall blockchain security.

Validators get [rewards in TON](/v3/documentation/infra/nodes/validation/staking-incentives/) for successful participation in the validation process.

To be entitled to propose and validate blocks, other participants elect validators based on the amount of TON they hold—in other words, their _stake_. The more TON a validator stakes, the higher its chances of being elected, validating blocks for the network, and earning rewards. As a rule, validator operators motivate other TON holders to stake with them to get passive income from the resulting rewards. In this way, validators ensure network stability and security and contribute to its growth.

## Interacting with TON nodes

TON nodes can run in **liteserver mode**, which allows lite clients (external applications) to interact with the TON blockchain. In this mode, the nodes process requests from lite clients, enabling them to access blockchain data, send transactions, and retrieve information about blocks and transactions—for instance, to fetch and update wallet balances.

Full and archive nodes typically enable liteserver mode because they store blockchain history and handle external requests. In contrast, validator nodes do not need it as they focus on validating new blocks efficiently without extra workload from external queries.

You have two options to allow your lite client application to interact with the TON blockchain:

1. To have a stable connection, you can run your own full or archive node with a liteserver mode enabled in your node configuration file.
2. If you cannot set up your TON node with a liteserver, you can use the mesh of public liteservers provided by the TON Foundation. For this purpose, use the following configuration files:
 - [Public liteserver configurations - Mainnet](https://ton.org/global-config.json)
 - [Public liteserver configurations - Testnet](https://ton.org/testnet-global.config.json)



:::caution Usage of public liteservers in production
Because of a permanent high load on public liteservers, most of them are rate-limited, so it is not recommended that they be used in production.
This may cause instability in your lite client application.

To interact with liteservers, you can use the following tools:

- TON [ADNL API](/v3/guidelines/dapps/apis-sdks/ton-adnl-apis/), the lowest-level method for communicating with the blockchain;
- TON [SDKs](/v3/guidelines/dapps/apis-sdks/sdk/), which are available for various programming languages;
- TON [HTTP-based APIs](/v3/concepts/dive-into-ton/ton-ecosystem/explorers-in-ton/) that provide REST API middleware between your application and a liteserver.
