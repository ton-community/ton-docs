![status](/img/docs/mytonctrl/status.png)

## TON network status

### Network name

Possible values are: `mainnet`, `testnet`, and `unknown`. However, the value `unknown` should never be displayed.

### Number of validators

There are two key values: one represented in green and the other in yellow. The green value indicates the number of online validators, while the yellow value represents the total number of validators.

Both values must be integers greater than 0. You can obtain the green value using the command `getconfig 34` with MyTonCtrl. For more information, please check the [relevant section here](/v3/documentation/network/configs/blockchain-configs#param-32-34-and-36) regarding parameters 32, 34, and 36.

### Number of shardchains

This value must be an integer greater than 0 and is displayed in green.

### Number of offers

- There are two values to note:
  - **Green**: Represents the number of `new offers`.
  - **Yellow**: Represents the total number of `all offers`.

### Number of complaints

- Similarly, there are two values to consider:
  - **Green**: Indicates the number of `new complaints`.
  - **Yellow**: Indicates the total number of `all complaints`.

### Election status

The election status can be indicated with green text for `open` or yellow text for `closed`.

## Local validator status

### Validator index

The validator index should be greater than or equal to 0 (which is the case if the validator mode is active). If it meets this requirement, it should be displayed in green; otherwise, it should be red.

### ADNL address of local validator

This section contains only the ADNL address.

### Local validator wallet address

The wallet address used for staking must be a valid TON address.

### Local validator wallet balance

This section shows the current balance of the wallet.

### Load average

The `load average` format is `[int]: int, int, int`. The first integer represents the number of CPUs, while the subsequent integers indicate the system load average for the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes.

### Network load average

This section also displays three integers, following the same logic as the `load average`: it presents the system load average for the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes.

### Memory load

**Absolute and Relative Memory Usage:** This refers to the usage of RAM and swap memory in two pairs of integers.

### Disk load average

This is similar to the `memory load`. However, it relates to the usage of all disk space instead.

### Mytoncore status

The status indicator should be green, showing how long Mytoncore has been operational.

### Local validator status

This indicator should also be green, displaying the uptime of the local validator.

### Local validator out of sync

This integer value should be less than 20, indicating that it is functioning properly (it will appear green).

### Local validator last state serialization

This entry displays the number of MasterChain blocks that are currently out of service.

### Local Validator database size

The absolute load size should be less than 1000 GB, and the relative load should be under 80%.

### Version of MyTonCtrl

This indicates the hash of the commit and the name of the branch.

### Version of validator

This shows the hash of the commit and the name of the branch.

## TON network configuration

### Configurator address

The address of the configurator. Refer to [this parameter-0](/v3/documentation/network/configs/blockchain-configs#param-0) for more information.

### Elector address

The address of the elector. Refer to [this parameter-1](/v3/documentation/network/configs/blockchain-configs#param-1) for additional details.

### Validation period

The duration of the validation period in seconds. Check [this parameter-15](/v3/documentation/network/configs/blockchain-configs#param-15).

### Duration of elections

This refers to the duration of elections in seconds. To know more, refer to [this parameter-15](/v3/documentation/network/configs/blockchain-configs#param-15).

### Hold period

The hold period in seconds, with details available at [this parameter-15](/v3/documentation/network/configs/blockchain-configs#param-15).

### Minimum stake

The minimum stake required in TONs. Check [this parameter-17](/v3/documentation/network/configs/blockchain-configs#param-17).

### Maximum stake

The maximum stake allowed in TONs. Check [this parameter-17](/v3/documentation/network/configs/blockchain-configs#param-17).

## TON timestamps

### TON network launch

This indicates the launch time of the current network, whether it is the Mainnet or Testnet.

### Start of the validation cycle

The timestamp indicates the beginning of the validation cycle. If it represents a future event, it will be displayed in green.

### End of the validation cycle

This is the timestamp for the end of the validation cycle; it will also appear green if it indicates a future date.

### Start of elections

The timestamp for when elections begin. This will be green if it represents a future date.

### End of elections

The timestamp indicating the end of elections is displayed in green if it predicts a future date.

### Beginning of the next elections

The timestamp for the start of the next elections will appear green if it signifies a future event.
