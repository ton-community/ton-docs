# Extra currency minting

## Extra currency

According to [TON Blockchain Whitepaper 3.1.6](https://ton-blockchain.github.io/docs/tblkch.pdf#page=55), the TON Blockchain allows users to create arbitrary cryptocurrencies or tokens, in addition to Toncoin, provided certain conditions are met. These additional cryptocurrencies are identified by 32-bit `currency_ids`. The list of these defined cryptocurrencies is a part of the blockchain configuration stored in the masterchain. Internal messages and account balances include a special field for `ExtraCurrencyCollection`, which is a set of extra currencies attached to a message or maintained in a balance:

```tlb
extra_currencies$_ dict:(HashmapE 32 (VarUInteger 32)) = ExtraCurrencyCollection;
currencies$_ grams:Grams other:ExtraCurrencyCollection = CurrencyCollection;
```

## Extra currency config

A dictionary, specifically `ExtraCurrencyCollection`, containing all currencies to be minted is stored in `ConfigParam 7`:

```tlb
_ to_mint:ExtraCurrencyCollection = ConfigParam 7;
```

`ConfigParam 6` contains data related to the minting:

```tlb
_ mint_new_price:Grams mint_add_price:Grams = ConfigParam 6;
```

`ConfigParam 2` contains the address of **minter**.

## Low-level minting flow

In each block, the collator compares the old global balance (the global balance of all currencies at the end of the previous block) with `ConfigParam 7`. If any amount for any currency in `ConfigParam 7` is less than the amount in the global balance, the config is invalid. If any amount of any currency in `ConfigParam 7` is greater than the amount in the global balance, a minting message will be created.

This minting message has source `-1:0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` and **minter** from `ConfigParam 2` as destination and contains excesses of extra currencies in `ConfigParam 7` over the old global balance.

The problem here is that the minting message includes only additional currencies and no Toncoins. As a result, even if the **minter** is designated as a fundamental smart contract (as indicated in `ConfigParam 31`), a minting message will lead to an aborted transaction with the error: `compute_ph:(tr_phase_compute_skipped reason:cskip_no_gas)`.

## High-level minting flow

One possible high-level minting flow, which is implemented [here](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/governance-contract/tree/50ed2ecacc9e3cff4c77cbcc69aa07b39f5c46a2) (see the .tolk files under `contracts/` in that repository) is as follows:
  
1. There is `ExtraCurrencyAuthorizationConfig`: the config contains information on which contracts (addresses) have authorization to request the minter to mint new extra currencies. This config has the following schema:

```tlb
_ (Hashmap 32 std_addr) = ExtraCurrencyAuthorizationConfig;
```

where the key is `currency_id`, and `std_addr` is the admin of this currency (can be in any workchain).

2. Minter accepts mint requests from **admins**, forwards minting requests to **config**, **config** updates `ConfigParam 7`, and responds to **minter**. Since extra currencies would be minted to **minter** only on the next masterchain block, withdrawing extra currencies to **admin** should be delayed. It is done via an **echo** smart contract (a round-trip delay), not in the masterchain. When a response from **echo** comes to **minter**, it sends extra currencies to **admin**. So the scheme is as follows: 

`Admin -> Minter -> Config -> Minter -> Echo (in another workchain to wait until the next masterchain block) -> Minter -> Admin`

An example of this flow is as follows: [minting 2'000'000'000 units of `currency_id=100`](https://testnet.tonviewer.com/transaction/20fe328c04b4896acecb6e96aaebfe6fef90dcc1441e27049302f29770904ef0)

:::danger
Each minting of a new extra currency or an increase in the supply of an existing currency necessitates a change to `ConfigParam 7`, which in turn alters the configuration and creation of key blocks. Frequent key block generation can slow down shard performance since each key block causes a rotation of validator groups and affects the synchronization of lite clients. Therefore, contracts like `swap.tolk` should not be utilized in production environments. Instead, it is advisable to use schemes that involve reserves to minimize minting events.

:::info
Sending an extra currency to a black hole (an unspendable address) has the following effect: the amount is burned, but since `ConfigParam 7` is not changed, in the next block **minter** will receive the burned amount back to its balance.

## How to mint your own extra currency

1. Ensure that your network has the **minter contract** and that `ConfigParam 2` and `ConfigParam 6` are set correctly.

2. Create a **currency admin contract** that will control how the extra currency is minted.

3. Submit a proposal to the validators to add your **currency admin** contract address to the `ExtraCurrencyAuthorizationConfig` for a specific `currency_id` and obtain their approval.

4. Send a `mint` request from the **currency admin contract** to the **minter**. Wait for the **minter** to return the extra currency.
