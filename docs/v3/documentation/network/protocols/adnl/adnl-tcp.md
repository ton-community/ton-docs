# ADNL TCP - Liteserver

This is the low level protocol on which all interaction in the TON network is built, it can work on top of any protocol, but is most often used on top of TCP and UDP. UDP is used for communication between nodes, and TCP is used for communication with lite servers.

Now we will analyze ADNL running over TCP and learn how to interact with lite servers directly.

In the TCP version of ADNL, network nodes use public keys ed25519 as addresses and establish a connection using a shared key obtained using the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman procedure - ECDH.

## Packet Structure
Each ADNL TCP packet, except for the handshake, has the following structure:
* 4 bytes of packet size in little endian (N)
* 32 bytes nonce (random bytes to protect against checksum attacks)
* (N - 64) payload bytes
* 32 bytes SHA256 checksum from nonce and payload

The entire packet, including the size, is **AES-CTR** encrypted.
After decryption, it is necessary to check whether the checksum matches the data, to check, you just need to calculate the checksum yourself and compare the result with what we have in the packet.

The handshake packet is an exception, it is transmitted in a partially unencrypted form and is described in the next chapter.

## Establishing a connection
To establish a connection, we need to know the ip, port and public key of the server, and generate our own private and public key ed25519.

Public server data such as ip, port and key can be obtained from the [global config](https://ton-blockchain.github.io/global.config.json). IP in the config in numerical form, it can be brought to normal form using, for example [this tool](https://www.browserling.com/tools/dec-to-ip). The public key in the config in base64 format.

The client generates 160 random bytes, some of which will be used by the parties as the basis for AES encryption.

Of these, 2 permanent AES-CTR ciphers are created, which will be used by the parties to encrypt/decrypt messages after the handshake.
* Cipher A - key 0 - 31 bytes, iv 64 - 79 bytes
* Cipher B - key 32 - 63 bytes, iv 80 - 95 bytes

The ciphers are applied in this order:
* Cipher A is used by the server to encrypt the messages it sends.
* Cipher A is used by the client to decrypt received messages.
* Cipher B is used by the client to encrypt the messages it sends.
* Cipher B is used by the server to decrypt received messages.

To establish a connection, the client must send a handshake packet containing:
* [32 bytes] **Server key ID** [[Details]](#getting-key-id)
* [32 bytes] **Our public key is ed25519**
* [32 bytes] **SHA256 hash from our 160 bytes**
* [160 bytes] **Our 160 bytes encrypted** [[Details]](#handshake-packet-data-encryption)

When receiving a handshake packet, the server will do the same actions, receive an ECDH key, decrypt 160 bytes and create 2 permanent keys. If everything works out, the server will respond with an empty ADNL packet, without payload, to decrypt which (as well as subsequent ones) we need to use one of the permanent ciphers.

From this point on, the connection can be considered established.

After we have established a connection, we can start receiving information; the TL language is used to serialize data.

[More about TL](/v3/documentation/data-formats/tl)

## Ping&Pong
It is optimal to send a ping packet once every 5 seconds. This is necessary to maintain the connection while no data is being transmitted, otherwise the server may terminate the connection.

The ping packet, like all the others, is built according to the standard schema described [above](#packet-structure), and carries the request ID and ping ID as payload data.

Let's find the desired schema for the ping request [here](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/ad736c6bc3c06ad54dc6e40d62acbaf5dae41584/tl/generate/scheme/ton_api.tl#L35) and calculate the schema id as
`crc32_IEEE("tcp.ping random_id:long = tcp.Pong")`. When converted to little endian bytes, we get **9a2b084d**.

Thus, our ADNL ping packet will look like this:
* 4 bytes of packet size in little endian -> 64 + (4+8) = **76**
* 32 bytes nonce -> random 32 bytes
* 4 bytes of ID TL schema -> **9a2b084d**
* 8 bytes of request id -> random uint64 number
* 32 bytes of SHA256 checksum from nonce and payload

We send our packet and wait for [tcp.pong](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/ad736c6bc3c06ad54dc6e40d62acbaf5dae41584/tl/generate/scheme/ton_api.tl#L23), `random_id` will be equal to the one we sent in ping packet.

## Receiving information from a Liteserver
All requests that are aimed at obtaining information from the blockchain are wrapped in [Liteserver Query](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/ad736c6bc3c06ad54dc6e40d62acbaf5dae41584/tl/generate/scheme/lite_api.tl#L83) schema, which in turn is wrapped in [ADNL Query](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/ad736c6bc3c06ad54dc6e40d62acbaf5dae41584/tl/generate/scheme/lite_api.tl#L22) schema.

LiteQuery:
`liteServer.query data:bytes = Object`, id **df068c79**

ADNLQuery:
`adnl.message.query query_id:int256 query:bytes = adnl.Message`, id **7af98bb4**

LiteQuery is passed inside ADNLQuery, as `query:bytes`, and the final query is passed inside LiteQuery, as `data:bytes`.

### getMasterchainInfo
Now, since we already know how to generate TL packets for the Lite API, we can request information about the current TON masterchain block.
The masterchain block is used in many further requests as an input parameter to indicate the state (moment) in which we need information.

We are looking for the [TL schema we need](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/ad736c6bc3c06ad54dc6e40d62acbaf5dae41584/tl/generate/scheme/lite_api.tl#L60), calculate its ID and build the packet:

* 4 bytes of packet size in little endian -> 64 + (4+32+(1+4+(1+4+3)+3)) = **116**
* 32 bytes nonce -> random 32 bytes
* 4 bytes of ID ADNLQuery schema -> **7af98bb4**
* 32 bytes `query_id:int256` -> random 32 bytes
  * 1 byte array size -> **12**
  * 4 byte of ID LiteQuery schema -> **df068c79**
    * 1 byte array size -> **4**
    * 4 bytes of ID getMasterchainInfo schema -> **2ee6b589**
    * 3 zero bytes of padding (alignment to 8)
  * 3 zero bytes of padding (alignment to 16)
* 32 bytes of checksum SHA256 from nonce and payload

```

In response, we expect to receive [liteServer.masterchainInfo](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/ad736c6bc3c06ad54dc6e40d62acbaf5dae41584/tl/generate/scheme/lite_api.tl#L30), consisting of last:[ton.blockIdExt](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/ad736c6bc3c06ad54dc6e40d62acbaf5dae41584/tl/generate/scheme/tonlib_api.tl#L51) state_root_hash:int256 and init:[tonNode.zeroStateIdExt](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/ad736c6bc3c06ad54dc6e40d62acbaf5dae41584/tl/generate/scheme/ton_api.tl#L359).

The received packet is deserialized in the same way as the sent one - has same algorithm, but in the opposite direction, except that the response is wrapped only in [ADNLAnswer](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/ad736c6bc3c06ad54dc6e40d62acbaf5dae41584/tl/generate/scheme/lite_api.tl#L23).

After decoding the response, we get a packet of the form:

### runSmcMethod
We already know how to get the masterchain block, so now we can call any lite server methods.
Let's analyze **runSmcMethod** - this is a method that calls a function from a smart contract and returns a result. Here we need to understand some new data types such as [TL-B](/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/tl-b-language), [Cell](/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/cell-boc#cell) and [BoC](/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/cell-boc#bag-of-cells).

To execute the smart contract method, we need to build and send a request using the TL schema:
```tlb
liteServer.runSmcMethod mode:# id:tonNode.blockIdExt account:liteServer.accountId method_id:long params:bytes = liteServer.RunMethodResult
```

And wait for a response with schema:
```tlb
liteServer.runMethodResult mode:# id:tonNode.blockIdExt shardblk:tonNode.blockIdExt shard_proof:mode.0?bytes proof:mode.0?bytes state_proof:mode.1?bytes init_c7:mode.3?bytes lib_extras:mode.4?bytes exit_code:int result:mode.2?bytes = liteServer.RunMethodResult;
```

In the request, we see the following fields:
1. mode:# - uint32 bitmask of what we want to see in the response, for example, `result:mode.2?bytes` will only be present in the response if the bit with index 2 is set to one.
2. id:tonNode.blockIdExt - is our master block state that we got in the previous chapter.
3. account:[liteServer.accountId](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/ad736c6bc3c06ad54dc6e40d62acbaf5dae41584/tl/generate/scheme/lite_api.tl#L27) - workchain and smart contract address data.
4. method_id:long - 8 bytes, in which crc16 with the XMODEM table is written on behalf of the called method + bit 17 is set [[Calculation]](https://github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go/blob/88f83bc3554ca78453dd1a42e9e9ea82554e3dd2/ton/runmethod.go#L16)
5. params:bytes - [Stack](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/ad736c6bc3c06ad54dc6e40d62acbaf5dae41584/crypto/block/block.tlb#L783) serialized in [BoC](/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/cell-boc#bag-of-cells), containing arguments to call the method. [[Implementation example]](https://github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go/blob/88f83bc3554ca78453dd1a42e9e9ea82554e3dd2/tlb/stack.go)

For example, we only need `result:mode.2?bytes`, then our mode will be equal to 0b100, that is 4. In response, we will get:
1. mode:# -> what was sent - 4.
2. id:tonNode.blockIdExt -> our master block against which the method was executed
3. shardblk:tonNode.blockIdExt -> shard block where the contract account is located
4. exit_code:int -> 4 bytes which is the exit code when executing the method. If everything is successful, then = 0, if not, it is equal to the exception code.
5. result:mode.2?bytes -> [Stack](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/ad736c6bc3c06ad54dc6e40d62acbaf5dae41584/crypto/block/block.tlb#L783) serialized in [BoC](/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/cell-boc#bag-of-cells), containing the values returned by the method.

Let's analyze the call and getting the result from the `a2` method of the contract `EQBL2_3lMiyywU17g-or8N7v9hDmPCpttzBPE2isF2GTzpK4`:

Method code in FunC:
```func
(cell, cell) a2() method_id {
  cell a = begin_cell().store_uint(0xAABBCC8, 32).end_cell();
  cell b = begin_cell().store_uint(0xCCFFCC1, 32).end_cell();
  return (a, b);
}
```

Fill out our request:
* `mode` = 4, we only need the result -> `04000000`
* `id` = result of execution getMasterchainInfo
* `account` = workchain 0 (4 bytes `00000000`), and int256 [obtained from our contract address](/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/tl-b-types#addresses), i.e. 32 bytes `4bdbfde5322cb2c14d7b83ea2bf0deeff610e63c2a6db7304f1368ac176193ce`
* `method_id` = [computed](https://github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go/blob/88f83bc3554ca78453dd1a42e9e9ea82554e3dd2/ton/runmethod.go#L16) id from `a2` -> `0a2e010000000000`
* `params:bytes` = Our method does not accept input parameters, so we need to pass it an empty stack (`000000`, cell 3 bytes - stack depth 0) serialized in [BoC](/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/cell-boc#bag-of-cells) -> `b5ee9c72010101010005000006000000` -> serialize in bytes and get `10b5ee9c72410101010005000006000000000000` 0x10 - size, 3 bytes in the end - padding.

In response, we get:
* `mode:#` -> not interesting
* `id:tonNode.blockIdExt` -> not interesting
* `shardblk:tonNode.blockIdExt` -> not interesting
* `exit_code:int` -> is 0 if execution was successful
* `result:mode.2?bytes` -> [Stack](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/ad736c6bc3c06ad54dc6e40d62acbaf5dae41584/crypto/block/block.tlb#L783) containing the data returned by the method in [BoC](/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/cell-boc#bag-of-cells) format, we will unpack it.

Inside `result` we received `b5ee9c7201010501001b000208000002030102020203030400080ccffcc1000000080aabbcc8`, this is [BoC](/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/cell-boc#bag-of-cells) containing the data. When we deserialize it, we will get a cell:
```json
32[00000203] -> {
  8[03] -> {
    0[],
    32[0AABBCC8]
  },
  32[0CCFFCC1]
}
```
If we parse it, we will get 2 values of the cell type, which our FunC method returns.
The first 3 bytes of the root cell `000002` - is the depth of the stack, that is 2. This means that the method returned 2 values.

We continue parsing, the next 8 bits (1 byte) is the value type at the current stack level. For some types, it may take 2 bytes. Possible options can be seen in [schema](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/ad736c6bc3c06ad54dc6e40d62acbaf5dae41584/crypto/block/block.tlb#L766).
In our case, we have `03`, which means:
```tlb
vm_stk_cell#03 cell:^Cell = VmStackValue;
```
So the type of our value is - cell, and, according to the schema, it stores the value itself as a reference. But, if we look at the stack element storage schema:
```tlb
vm_stk_cons#_ {n:#} rest:^(VmStackList n) tos:VmStackValue = VmStackList (n + 1);
```
We will see that the first link `rest:^(VmStackList n)` - is the cell of the next value on the stack, and our value `tos:VmStackValue` comes second, so to get the value we need to read the second link, that is `32[0CCFFCC1]` - this is our first cell that the contract returned.

Now we can go deeper and get the second element of the stack, we go through the first link, now we have:
```json
8[03] -> {
    0[],
    32[0AABBCC8]
  }
```
We repeat the same process. The first 8 bits = `03` - that is, again cell. The second reference is the value `32[0AABBCC8]` and since our stack depth is 2, we complete the pass. n total, we have 2 values returned by the contract - `32[0CCFFCC1]` and `32[0AABBCC8]`.

Note that they are in reverse order. In the same way, you need to pass arguments when calling a function - in reverse order from what we see in the FunC code.

[Implementation example](https://github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go/blob/46dbf5f820af066ab10c5639a508b4295e5aa0fb/ton/runmethod.go#L24)

### getAccountState
To get account state data such as balance, code and contract data, we can use [getAccountState](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/ad736c6bc3c06ad54dc6e40d62acbaf5dae41584/tl/generate/scheme/lite_api.tl#L68). For the request, we need a [fresh master block](#getmasterchaininfo) and account address. In response, we will receive the TL structure [AccountState](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/ad736c6bc3c06ad54dc6e40d62acbaf5dae41584/tl/generate/scheme/lite_api.tl#L38).

Let's analyze the AccountState TL schema:
```tlb
liteServer.accountState id:tonNode.blockIdExt shardblk:tonNode.blockIdExt shard_proof:bytes proof:bytes state:bytes = liteServer.AccountState;
```
1. `id` - is our master block, regarding which we got the data.
2. `shardblk` - workchain shard block where our account is located, regarding which we received data.
3. `shard_proof` - merkle proof of a shard block.
4. `proof` - merkle proof of account status.
5. `state` - [BoC](/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/cell-boc#bag-of-cells) TL-B [account state scheme](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/ad736c6bc3c06ad54dc6e40d62acbaf5dae41584/crypto/block/block.tlb#L232).

Of all this data, what we need is in the state, we will analyze it.

For example, let's get the status of account `EQAhE3sLxHZpsyZ_HecMuwzvXHKLjYx4kEUehhOy2JmCcHCT`, `state` in the response will be (at the moment of writing this article):

Now we need to parse the cell according to the TL-B structure:
```tlb
account_none$0 = Account;

account$1 addr:MsgAddressInt storage_stat:StorageInfo
          storage:AccountStorage = Account;
```
Our structure references other structures, such as:
```tlb
anycast_info$_ depth:(#<= 30) { depth >= 1 } rewrite_pfx:(bits depth) = Anycast;
addr_std$10 anycast:(Maybe Anycast) workchain_id:int8 address:bits256  = MsgAddressInt;
addr_var$11 anycast:(Maybe Anycast) addr_len:(## 9) workchain_id:int32 address:(bits addr_len) = MsgAddressInt;
   
storage_info$_ used:StorageUsed last_paid:uint32 due_payment:(Maybe Grams) = StorageInfo;
storage_used$_ cells:(VarUInteger 7) bits:(VarUInteger 7) public_cells:(VarUInteger 7) = StorageUsed;
  
account_storage$_ last_trans_lt:uint64 balance:CurrencyCollection state:AccountState = AccountStorage;

currencies$_ grams:Grams other:ExtraCurrencyCollection = CurrencyCollection;
           
var_uint$_ {n:#} len:(#< n) value:(uint (len * 8)) = VarUInteger n;
var_int$_ {n:#} len:(#< n) value:(int (len * 8)) = VarInteger n;
nanograms$_ amount:(VarUInteger 16) = Grams;  
           
account_uninit$00 = AccountState;
account_active$1 _:StateInit = AccountState;
account_frozen$01 state_hash:bits256 = AccountState;
```

As we can see, the cell contains a lot of data, but we will analyze the main cases and getting a balance. You can analyze the rest in a similar way.

Let's start parsing. In the root cell data we have:
```
C0021137B0BC47669B3267F1DE70CBB0CEF5C728B8D8C7890451E8613B2D899827026A886043179D3F6000006E233BE8722201D7D239DBA7D818130_
```
Convert it to binary form and get:
```
11000000000000100001000100110111101100001011110001000111011001101001101100110010011001111111000111011110011100001100101110110000110011101111010111000111001010001011100011011000110001111000100100000100010100011110100001100001001110110010110110001001100110000010011100000010011010101000100001100000010000110001011110011101001111110110000000000000000000000110111000100011001110111110100001110010001000100000000111010111110100100011100111011011101001111101100000011000000100110
```
Let's look at our main TL-B structure, we see that we have 2 options for what can be there - `account_none$0` or `account$1`. We can understand which option we have by reading the prefix declared after the symbol $, in our case it is 1 bit. If there is 0, then we have `account_none`, or 1, then `account`.

Our first bit from the data above = 1, so we are working with `account$1` and will use the schema:
```tlb
account$1 addr:MsgAddressInt storage_stat:StorageInfo
          storage:AccountStorage = Account;
```
Next we have `addr:MsgAddressInt`, we see that for MsgAddressInt we also have several options:
```tlb
addr_std$10 anycast:(Maybe Anycast) workchain_id:int8 address:bits256  = MsgAddressInt;
addr_var$11 anycast:(Maybe Anycast) addr_len:(## 9) workchain_id:int32 address:(bits addr_len) = MsgAddressInt;
```
To understand which one to work with, we, like last time, read the prefix bits, this time we read 2 bits. We cut off the already read bit, `1000000...` remains, we read the first 2 bits and get `10`, which means we are working with `addr_std$10`.

Next we need to parse `anycast:(Maybe Anycast)`, Maybe means we should read 1 bit, and if it's one, read Anycast, otherwise skip. Our remaining bits are `00000...`, read 1 bit, it's 0, so we skip Anycast.

Next, we have `workchain_id: int8`, everything is simple here, we read 8 bits, this will be the workchain ID. We read the next 8 bits, all zeros, so the workchain is 0.

Next, we read `address:bits256`, this is 256 bits of the address, in the same way as with `workchain_id`. On reading, we get `21137B0BC47669B3267F1DE70CBB0CEF5C728B8D8C7890451E8613B2D8998270` in hex representation.


We read the address `addr:MsgAddressInt`, then we have `storage_stat:StorageInfo` from the main structure, its schema is:
```tlb
storage_info$_ used:StorageUsed last_paid:uint32 due_payment:(Maybe Grams) = StorageInfo;
```
First comes `used:StorageUsed`, with the schema:
```tlb
storage_used$_ cells:(VarUInteger 7) bits:(VarUInteger 7) public_cells:(VarUInteger 7) = StorageUsed;
```
This is the number of cells and bits used to store account data. Each field is defined as `VarUInteger 7`, which means a uint of dynamic size, but a maximum of 7 bits. You can understand how it is arranged according to the scheme:
```tlb
var_uint$_ {n:#} len:(#< n) value:(uint (len * 8)) = VarUInteger n;
```
In our case, n will be equal to 7. In len we will have `(#< 7)` which means the number of bits that can hold a number up to 7. You can determine it by translating 7-1=6 into binary form - `110`, we get 3 bits, so length len = 3 bits. And value is `(uint (len * 8))`. To determine it, we need to read 3 bits of the length, get a number and multiply by 8, this will be the size of `value`, that is, the number of bits that need to be read to get the value of VarUInteger.

Read `cells:(VarUInteger 7)`, take our next bits from the root cell, look at the next 16 bits to understand, this is `0010011010101000`. We read the first 3 bits of len, this is `001`, i.e. 1, we get the size (uint (1 * 8)), we get uint 8, we read 8 bits, it will be `cells`, `00110101`, i.e. 53 in decimal form. We do the same for `bits` and `public_cells`.

We successfully read `used:StorageUsed`, next we have `last_paid:uint32`, we read 32 bits. Everything is just as simple with `due_payment:(Maybe Grams)` here Maybe, which will be 0, so we skip Grams. But, if Maybe is 1, we can look at the Grams `amount:(VarUInteger 16) = Grams` schema and immediately understand that we already know how to work with this. Like last time, only instead of 7 we have 16.

Next we have `storage:AccountStorage` with a schema:
```tlb
account_storage$_ last_trans_lt:uint64 balance:CurrencyCollection state:AccountState = AccountStorage;
```
We read `last_trans_lt:uint64`, this is 64 bits, storing lt of the last account transaction. And finally, the balance represented by the schema:
```tlb
currencies$_ grams:Grams other:ExtraCurrencyCollection = CurrencyCollection;
```
From here we will read `grams:Grams` which will be the account balance in nano-tones.
`grams:Grams` is `VarUInteger 16`, to store 16 (in binary form `10000`, subtracting 1 we get `1111`), then we read the first 4 bits, and multiply the resulting value by 8, then we read the received number of bits, it is our balance.

Let's analyze our remaining bits according to our data:
```
100000000111010111110100100011100111011011101001111101100000011000000100110
```
Read first 4 bits - `1000`, this is 8. 8*8=64, read next 64 bits = `0000011101011111010010001110011101101110100111110110000001100000`, removing extra zero bits, we get `11101011111010010001110011101101110100111110110000001100000`, that is equal to `531223439883591776`, and, translating from nano to TON, we get `531223439.883591776`.

We will stop here, since we have already analyzed all the main cases, the rest can be obtained in a similar way with what we have analyzed. Also, additional information on parsing TL-B can be found in [official documentation](/v3/documentation/data-formats/tlb/tl-b-language)

### Other methods
Now, having studied all the information, you can call and process responses for other lite-server methods as well. Same principle :)

## Additional technical details of the handshake

### Getting key ID
The key id is the SHA256 hash of the serialized TL schema.

The most commonly used TL schemas for the keys are:
```tlb
pub.ed25519 key:int256 = PublicKey -- ID c6b41348
pub.aes key:int256 = PublicKey     -- ID d4adbc2d
pub.overlay name:bytes = PublicKey -- ID cb45ba34
pub.unenc data:bytes = PublicKey   -- ID 0a451fb6
pk.aes key:int256 = PrivateKey     -- ID 3751e8a5
```

As an example, for keys of type ED25519 that are used for handshake, the key ID will be the SHA256 hash from
**[0xC6, 0xB4, 0x13, 0x48]** and **public key**, (36 byte array, prefix + key)

[Code example](https://github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go/blob/2b5e5a0e6ceaf3f28309b0833cb45de81c580acc/liteclient/crypto.go#L16)

### Handshake packet data encryption
The handshake packet is sent in a semi-open form, only 160 bytes are encrypted, containing information about permanent ciphers.

To encrypt them, we need an AES-CTR cipher, to get it we need a SHA256 hash of 160 bytes and [ECDH shared key](#getting-a-shared-key-using-ecdh)

The cipher is built like this:
* key = (0 - 15 bytes of public key) + (16 - 31 bytes of hash)
* iv = (0 - 3 hash bytes) + (20 - 31 public key bytes)

After the cipher is assembled, we encrypt our 160 bytes with it.

[Code example](https://github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go/blob/2b5e5a0e6ceaf3f28309b0833cb45de81c580acc/liteclient/connection.go#L361)

### Getting a shared key using ECDH
To calculate the shared key, we need our private key and the server's public key.

The essence of DH is to obtain a shared secret key, without disclosing private information. I will give an example of how this happens, in the most simplified form. Suppose we need to generate a shared key between us and the server, the process will look like this:
1. We generate secret and public numbers like **6** and **7**
2. The server generates secret and public numbers like **5** and **15**
3. We exchange public numbers with the server, send **7** to the server, it sends us **15**.
4. We calculate: **7^6 mod 15 = 4**
5. The server calculates: **7^5 mod 15 = 7**
6. We exchange the received numbers, we give the server **4**, it gives us **7**
7. We calculate **7^6 mod 15 = 4**
8. The server calculates: **4^5 mod 15 = 4**
9. Shared key = **4**

The details of the ECDH itself will be omitted for the sake of simplicity. It is calculated using 2 keys, private and public, by finding a common point on the curve. If interested, it is better to read about it separately.

[Code example](https://github.com/xssnick/tonutils-go/blob/2b5e5a0e6ceaf3f28309b0833cb45de81c580acc/liteclient/crypto.go#L32)
