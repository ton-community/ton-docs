# Overview

The Abstract Datagram Network Layer (ADNL) is a fundamental component of TON.

ADNL is a peer-to-peer, unreliable datagram protocol in the TON networking stack. ADNL operates over UDP and TCP.

## ADNL address

Each participant in the network possesses a 256-bit ADNL address.

The ADNL protocol enables the sending and receiving of datagrams using only ADNL addresses, concealing the underlying IP addresses and ports.

An ADNL address is a 256‑bit identifier derived as SHA‑256(type_id || public_key), where `type_id` is a little‑endian uint32 indicating the key type — that is, the SHA‑256 of the TL‑serialized key object. The corresponding private key must be known to receive and decrypt messages intended for a specific address.

## Encryption and security

ADNL packets can be signed and encrypted; when signatures are present, recipients verify integrity and authenticity.

## Neighbor tables

A TON ADNL node will typically maintain a **neighbor table** that contains information about other known nodes, including their abstract addresses, public keys, IP addresses, and UDP ports. Over time, this table is updated: new entries are discovered from responses to specific queries, and outdated records are removed.

Higher-level protocols such as [RLDP](/v3/documentation/network/protocols/rldp) operate over ADNL.
