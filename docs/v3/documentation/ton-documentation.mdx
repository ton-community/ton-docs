# TON documentation

Welcome to the official **TON Blockchain** development documentation!

This resource provides everything you need to *build*, *test*, and *deploy* applications on the TON Blockchain.

This is a collaborative, open-source initiative, and **contributions are always welcome**. All documentation can be edited via GitHub by following [these instructions](/v3/contribute).


* _The TON Hello World_ series provides detailed step-by-step guides to wallets, smart contracts, mini apps, and testing and debugging smart contracts on TON.
* _Get started with TON_ is a step-by-step guide to interacting with TON Blockchain - complete with a video tutorial.

## Smart contracts development
Smart contracts are the building blocks of decentralized applications (dApps) on the TON Blockchain.
If you're looking to develop your dApps, it's essential to understand how a smart contract works within the TON ecosystem.

## DApp development
Decentralized applications (DApps) run on a peer-to-peer network—such as the TON Blockchain—rather than on a single server.
They function similarly to traditional web applications but are built on a blockchain, making them *decentralized*, meaning no single entity controls the application.
