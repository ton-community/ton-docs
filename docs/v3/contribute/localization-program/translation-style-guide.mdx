# Translation style guide

This translation style guide contains essential guidelines, instructions, and tips for translators, helping us localize the website.

This document serves as a general guide and is not specific to any language.

## Capturing the essence of the message

When translating TON Docs content, avoid literal translations.

The translations must capture the essence of the message. This approach means rephrasing specific phrases or using descriptive translations instead of translating the content word for word.

Different languages have different grammar rules, conventions, and word order. When translating, please be mindful of structuring sentences in the target language, and avoid word-for-word translation of the English source, as this can lead to poor sentence structure and readability.

Instead of translating the source text word for word, you should read the entire sentence and adapt it to fit the conventions of the target language.

## Formal vs. informal

We use the formal form of address, which is always polite and appropriate for all visitors.

Using the formal address allows us to avoid sounding unofficial or offensive and works regardless of the reader’s age and gender.

Most Indo-European and Afro-Asiatic languages use gender-specific second-person personal pronouns, distinguishing between males and females. When addressing the user or using possessive pronouns, we can avoid assuming the reader’s gender, as the formal address is generally applicable and consistent, regardless of how they identify.

## Straightforward vocabulary and meaning

Our goal is to make content on the website understandable to as many people as possible.

In most cases, contributors can achieve this result by using short and simple words that are easily understandable. If multiple possible translations exist for a word in your language with the same meaning, the best option is often the shortest word reflecting the meaning.

## Writing system

Translate using your language’s writing system, except for standard acronyms, brand names, ISO codes, and proper names defined in the [Glossary](/v3/concepts/glossary).

**Do not translate proper names defined in the [Glossary](/v3/concepts/glossary).**

## Translating page metadata

Some pages contain metadata, such as `title`, `lang`, `description`, `sidebar`, etc.

When uploading new pages to Crowdin, we hide content that translators should never translate. This feature makes only the text that should be translated visible to translators in Crowdin.

Please be especially careful when translating strings where the source text is 'en'. This represents the language page, which is available and should be translated to the [ISO language code for your language](https://www.andiamo.co.uk/resources/iso-language-codes/). These strings should always be entered using Latin characters, not the writing system native to the target language.

Some examples of language codes for the most widely spoken languages:

- English - en  
- Simplified Chinese - zh-CN  
- Russian - ru  
- Korean - ko  
- Polish - pl  
- Ukrainian - uk  

## Titles of external articles

Some strings contain titles of external articles. Most of our developer documentation pages contain links to external articles for further reading. The strings containing article titles need to be translated, regardless of the article's language, to ensure a more consistent user experience for visitors viewing the page in their language.

## Crowdin warnings

Crowdin has a built-in feature that warns translators when they are about to make a mistake. Crowdin will automatically alert you before saving your translation if you forget to include a tag from the source, translate elements that should not be translated, add several consecutive spaces, forget the end punctuation, etc. If you see a warning like this, please double-check the suggested translation.

:::warning
Never ignore these warnings, as they usually mean something is wrong or the translation lacks a key part of the source text.

## Short vs. complete forms and abbreviations

The website uses many abbreviations, such as apps, DApps, NFT, DAO, DeFi, etc. These abbreviations are standard in English, and most visitors are familiar with them.

Since they usually don’t have established translations in other languages, the best approach to these and similar terms is to provide a descriptive translation of the entire form and add the English abbreviation in brackets.  

Do not translate English abbreviations into localized versions, since they would not make much sense to most visitors.

Example of how to translate DApps:

- Decentralized applications (DApps) → Translated in complete form (English abbreviation in brackets)

## Terms without established translations

Some terms might not have established translations in other languages but are widely known by their original English names. Such terms include newer concepts, like proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, Beacon Chain, staking, etc.

While translating these terms can sound unnatural, since the English version serves as the basis for other languages, it is highly recommended that they be translated.

Feel free to get creative, use descriptive translations, or translate them literally.

Most terms should be translated instead of leaving some in English, as this new terminology will become more widespread as more people start using TON and related technologies. To onboard more people to TON, we must provide understandable terminology in as many languages as possible, even if we need to create it ourselves.

## Buttons & CTAs

Translate the website’s UI text, including buttons.

You may identify button text by viewing the context screenshots connected with most strings or by checking the context in the editor, which includes the phrase `button`.

Button translations should be as short as possible to prevent formatting mismatches. Additionally, button translations, i.e., presenting a command or request, should be imperative.

## Translating for inclusivity

TON Docs visitors come from all over the world and from different backgrounds. Therefore, the language on the website should be neutral, welcoming to everyone, and not exclusive.

Gender neutrality is an essential aspect of this. Use the formal address form and avoid gender-specific words in the translations.

Another form of inclusivity is trying to translate for a global audience, not specific to any country, race, or region.

Finally, the language should be suitable for all audiences and ages.

## Language-specific translations

When translating, it is crucial to follow the grammar rules, conventions, and formatting used in your language instead of copying from the source. The source text follows English grammar rules and conventions, which do not apply to many other languages.

You should be aware of the rules for your language and translate accordingly. If you need help, [contact us](https://t.me/+c-0fVO4XHQsyOWM8); we will help you with resources on translating elements for your language.

Some examples of what to be particularly mindful of:

### Punctuation and formatting

#### Capitalization

- There are vast differences in capitalization in different languages.  
- In English, it is common to capitalize all words in titles and names, months and days, language names, holidays, etc. In many other languages, this is grammatically incorrect, as they have different capitalization rules.  
- Some languages also have rules about capitalizing personal pronouns, nouns, and adjectives that you shouldn't capitalize in English.  

#### Spacing

Spacing before units, degree signs, certain punctuation (such as ellipses), and around slashes varies by language. Translators should follow their language’s orthographic rules.

#### Lists

- Every language has a diverse and complex set of rules for writing lists. These can be significantly different from English.  
- In some languages, the first word of each new line needs to be capitalized, while in others, new lines should start with lowercase letters. Many languages also have different rules about capitalization in lists, depending on the length of each line.  
- The same applies to the punctuation of line items. The end punctuation in lists can be a period (.), comma (,), or semicolon (;), depending on the language.  

#### Quotation marks

- Languages use many different quotation marks. Simply copying the English quotation marks from the source is often incorrect.  
- Some of the most common types of quotation marks include:  
  - „example text“  
  - ‚example text’  
  - »example text«  
  - “example text”  
  - ‘example text’  
  - «example text»  

#### Hyphens and dashes

- In English, use an en dash (–) for ranges and an em dash (—) for pauses.  
  - Example: Use an em dash—like this—to indicate a pause.  
- Many languages have different rules for using hyphens and dashes that should be observed.  

### Formats

#### Numbers

- The main difference in writing numbers in different languages is the separator for decimals and thousands. For thousands, this can be a period, comma, or space. Similarly, some languages use a decimal point, while others use a decimal comma.  
  - Example:  
    - English – **1,000.50**  
    - Spanish – **1.000,50**  
    - French – **1 000,50**  
- The percent sign is another critical consideration when translating numbers. Write numbers in the typical format for the corresponding language.  
  - Example: **100%**, **100 %**, or **%100**.  
- Finally, negative numbers can be displayed differently, depending on the language.  
  - Example: -100, 100-, (100), or [100].  

#### Dates

- When translating dates, there are several considerations and differences based on the language. These include the date format, separator, capitalization, and leading zeros. There are also differences between full-length and numerical dates.  
  - Some examples of different date formats:  
    - English UK (dd/mm/yyyy) – 1 January 2022  
    - English US (mm/dd/yyyy) – January 1, 2022  
    - Chinese (yyyy-mm-dd) – 2022 年 1 月 1 日  
    - French (dd/mm/yyyy) – 1er janvier 2022  
    - Italian (dd/mm/yyyy) – 1º gennaio 2022  
    - German (dd/mm/yyyy) – 1. Januar 2022  

#### Currencies

- The main differences in writing currencies in different languages include symbol placement, decimal commas vs. decimal points, spacing, and abbreviations vs. symbols.  
  - Symbol placement: $100 or 100 €  
  - Decimal commas vs. decimal points: $100.50 or 100,50 €  
  - Spacing: $100 or 100 €  
  - Abbreviations vs. symbols: $100 or 100 USD  
- Note: symbol placement, spacing, and format are language-dependent.  

#### Units of measure

- As a general rule, please keep the units of measure as per the source. You can include the conversion in brackets if your country uses a different system.  
- Aside from the localization of units of measure, it is also important to note the differences in how languages approach these units. The main difference is the spacing between the number and unit, which can differ based on the language. Examples of this include 100kB vs. 100 kB or 50°C vs. 50 °F.  

## Conclusion

When translating, try not to rush. Take it easy and have fun!
