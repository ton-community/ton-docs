# Localization program

Localization is a collaborative effort to translate TON-related documents into multiple languages, making the website accessible to non-English speakers worldwide.

## System design philosophy

The localization process is fully maintained by [TownSquare Labs](https://github.com/TownSquareXYZ).

TownSquare is committed to creating an open infrastructure for multilingual community collaboration to advance TON to the next phase. This initiative includes:

- **Suitable for multilingual communities**

  The program supports multiple languages, ensuring inclusivity and ease of access for users from diverse linguistic backgrounds.

- **Automation of development, integration, and deployment**

  The program simplifies development, integration, and deployment through automation tools, reducing manual efforts and enhancing efficiency and consistency across localization efforts.

- **Separation of roles among developers, translators, and proofreaders**

  Our approach divides the responsibilities of developers, translators, and verifiers, allowing each role to focus on their tasks and ensuring high-quality translations and seamless collaboration without role conflicts.

- **Acknowledgements for community contributions**

  We recognize community contributions (see Acknowledgements below). This fosters active participation and promotes a sense of ownership and community engagement.

- **Machine translation assistance (e.g., DeepL)**

  Machine translation improves translation accuracy and efficiency by offering intelligent suggestions and automating repetitive tasks, ensuring high-quality outcomes with reduced effort.

This project is designed to support speakers of multiple languages and serve the global developer ecosystem.

## Acknowledgements

We sincerely appreciate the thousands of community members who are integral to the localization program. We aim to acknowledge our translators and support their career growth. In the future, we plan to create leaderboards and a list of all contributors.
