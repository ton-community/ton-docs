For optimal user experience and clarity, please keep in mind the list of general and important requirements that we aim to apply to all documentation on docs.ton.org while creating new content.


## Documentation crafted for Professionals
Documentations pages is primarily intended for documentation purposes and not as a tutorial, so it is important to minimize the use of personal examples or analogies in the text. It is crucial to ensure that the content is suitable for both professionals and non-professionals alike, while still providing valuable information.

## Use a consistent format
To make it easier for readers to navigate through the documentation, it is important to use a consistent format throughout the document. Use headings, subheadings, bullet points, and numbered lists to break up the text and make it easier to read.

## Provide examples in special section
Providing examples can help readers better understand the content and how to apply it. If you are writing documentation page and need refer several examples, please create special section Examples right before References and See Also sections. Do not mix description and examples in documentation pages. 
Use code snippets, screenshots, or diagrams to illustrate your points and make the documentation more engaging.

## Keep it up to date
Tech documentation can quickly become outdated due to changes in technology or software updates. It is important to review and update the documentation regularly to ensure that it remains accurate and relevant to the current version of the software.

## Get feedback
Before publishing the documentation, it is a good idea to get feedback from other contributors or users. This can help identify areas that may be confusing or unclear, and allow you to make improvements before the documentation is released.
