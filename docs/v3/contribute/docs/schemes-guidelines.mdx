Maintaining consistency in documentation is crucial, and to achieve this, a specific standard for visualizing processes in smart contracts has been developed.

## Graphic explanation notation

### Message processing graph

To depict message processing, it's advisable to utilize a graphical representation resembling a smart contract graph, complete with labels for transactions and messages.

If the order of transactions doesn't matter, you can omit their labels. This simplifies the diagram, making it easier to read and understand the details related to messages and contracts.

#### Annotation primitives

  light: '/img/docs/scheme-templates/message-processing-graphs/Graphic-Explanations-Guidelines_1.png?raw=true',
  dark: '/img/docs/scheme-templates/message-processing-graphs/Graphic-Explanations-Guidelines_1_dark.png?raw=true',
}}
/>

- Avoid using many different bright colors.
- Use shape variations (e.g., dashed borders) to differentiate elements.
- Display different transactions with distinct line styles (solid or dashed) for clarity.

#### Message processing example

}}
/>

Use the Visio source file for reference: [message_processing.vsdx](/schemes-visio/message_processing.vsdx).

### Formats and colors

#### Fonts

- Use the Inter font family for all text in diagrams.

#### Colors - light mode

- Pencil Hand Drawn (default theme)

#### Colors - dark mode

- Font `#e3e3e3`
- Background `#232328`
- Light highlight (arrows and scheme borders) `#058dd2`
- Dark highlight (arrows and scheme borders) `#0088cc`
- Inner background (for nested blocks) `#333337`

#### Version control policy

- Use SVG format for diagrams to ensure readability on various devices.
- Store original files in the project's Git repository under the `static/schemes-visio` directory (served at `/schemes-visio`), making them easier to modify in the future.

### Sequence diagram

In the case of complex and repetitive communication schemes between 2-3 actors, it is advisable to use a sequence diagram. For messages, use the notation of a common synchronous message arrow.

#### Example

<div class="text--center">
  <ThemedImage
    alt="Sequence diagram example with two actors"
    sources={{
  light: '/img/docs/message-delivery/message_delivery_7.png?raw=true',
  dark: '/img/docs/message-delivery/message_delivery_7_dark.png?raw=true',
}}
  />
</div>
