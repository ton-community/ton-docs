For clarity and a better user experience, follow these general requirements across the TON documentation when creating new content.

## Documentation crafted for professionals
Documentation pages are primarily intended for reference, not tutorials. Minimize personal examples or analogies, and ensure the content is suitable for both professionals and nonâ€‘professionals.

## Use a consistent format
To make it easier for readers to navigate through the documentation, it is important to use a consistent format throughout the document. Use headings, subheadings, bullet points, and numbered lists to break up the text and make it easier to read.

## Provide examples in a dedicated section
If you are writing a documentation page and need to refer to several examples, create a dedicated `## Examples` section near the end of the page. Do not mix description and examples on documentation pages. Use code snippets, screenshots, or diagrams to illustrate your points.

## Keep it up to date
Technical documentation can quickly become outdated due to changes in technology or software updates. It is important to review and update the documentation regularly to ensure that it remains accurate and relevant to the current version of the software.

## Get feedback
Before publishing the documentation, it is a good idea to get feedback from other contributors or users. This can help identify areas that may be confusing or unclear, and allow you to make improvements before the documentation is released.
