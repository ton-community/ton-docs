## Introduction

The Introduction heading **must** be H2: `## Introduction`

This section is for you to explain the context of this tutorial and why it is important, what we're going to build and learn in this tutorial.

- Explain this section like you're explaining it to a 5-year-old (**[ELI5](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/eli5/)**)
- Explain everything in 5â€“6 lines maximum.

*For example:*

>A smart contract is just a computer program that runs on TON Blockchain, or more specifically on its [TVM](/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-overview) (_TON Virtual Machine_). The contract is made of code (_compiled TVM instructions_) and data (_persistent state_) that are stored at some address on TON.

## Prerequisites

The Prerequisites heading **must** be H2: `## Prerequisites`

This section is for you to explain any prior knowledge needed or any existing tutorials that need to be completed first. Any tokens that are neededâ€”mention them here.

*For example:*

>In this tutorial, we're going to mint Jetton on testnet. Before we continue, make sure that your [testnet](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/getting-started/testnet) wallet has sufficient balance. 

## Requirements

The Requirements heading **must** be H2: `## Requirements`

**OPTIONAL :** Embed any video content in this section if your tutorial has any.

Any technology that needs to be installed **prior** to starting the tutorial and that the tutorial will not cover (`TON Wallet Extension`, `node`, etc.). Do not list packages that will be installed during the tutorial.

*For example:*

- We'll need the TON Wallet extension in this tutorial; install it from [HERE](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ton-wallet/nphplpgoakhhjchkkhmiggakijnkhfnd).
- Make sure to have NodeJS 12.0.1+ installed.

## Body of the Tutorial

- Please do not use "Body of the Tutorial" as a heading, use your own heading that is relevant to the material.
  - "Getting started" is acceptable if you can't think of anything else ðŸ˜‰
- Add any text content necessary to guide readers through your tutorial, and ***remember to proofread your content*** for spelling and grammar before you submit your tutorial.
  - [Grammarly](http://grammarly.com) is a good free program that can help you avoid grammar mistakes.

### Key points

- Do not use "Body of the Tutorial" as a heading!
- **Keep all subheadings at H3,** don't go for H4 or any lower.
    - In Markdown syntax, two hashmarks are used for H2 headings: ##
    - Three hashmarks are used for H3 headings: ###
- Add only necessary comments to code blocks. ***Do not*** add # style comments to terminal input code blocks.
- Add all relevant code blocks:
    - Markdown syntax for code blocks consists of three backticks at the beginning and end of the code block.  Also, make sure that there is a newline before and after the backticks in all code blocks. *For example*:
        - 
        \```js  
        const testVariable = 'some string';  
        someFunctionCall();  
        \```  
        
    - ALL code blocks ***must*** have a syntax highlight type. Use ```text if you are not sure.
    - \```text must be used for terminal output, terminal commands, and plaintext.
    - \```javascript *or* ```js can be used for any JavaScript code.
    - \```typescript or ```ts can be used for any TypeScript code.
    - \```jsx is for ReactJS code.
    - \```cpp is for Func code.
    - Use \```graphql when highlighting GraphQL syntax.
    - Use \```json when highlighting valid JSON. (For invalid JSON examples use \```text instead.)
    - \```bash should *only* be used in code blocks where you need to have # style comments. This must be done carefully because in many situations the # character will render as a markdown heading. Typically, the Table of Contents will be affected if this occurs.
- Do not use `pre-formatted text` for emphasis; instead, use only **bold** or *italic* text.
- Add images or code blocks to reflect the expected terminal output.

- Take an error-driven approach when writing your tutorial. Add common errors and troubleshooting steps. *For example:*

> **Unable to connect to Testnet due to an error when executing the
> `node deploy:testnet` command.** 
>
> Let's look at some common causes:
>  
* Make sure you have enough funds in your generated testnet wallet in `.env`. If not, please add some testnet coins from the faucet giver. 
* If you're still experiencing the same issue, reach out to the devs in the [Dev Chat](https://t.me/TonDev_eng/) for help.

## Conclusion

The Conclusion heading **must** be H2: `## Conclusion`

This section should summarize what was learned in the tutorial, reinforce key points, and congratulate the learner on completing the tutorial. Use a maximum of 5â€“6 lines.
*For example*:

> We created a simple new FunC contract with counter functionality. We then built and deployed it on-chain, and finally interacted with it by calling a getter and sending a message.


Please remember that this code is not meant for production; there are still a few other things to consider if you wanted to deploy this to mainnet, such as disabling the transfer method if the token is listed on the market, and so on.
