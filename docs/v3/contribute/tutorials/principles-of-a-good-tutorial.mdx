Here is a summary of these points for new contributors.

## Principles

1. The full flow should run on the user's device. Prefer fully client-side flows; if external services are required, document self-hosted alternatives and rationale. You need to do everything so that the user can simply clone the repository and immediately run it.

2. The README should be very detailed. Do not assume users know anything. If the tutorial requires it, it should also explain how to install the FunC compiler or lite-client on your device. You can copy these parts from other tutorials in this documentation.

3. Include the whole source code for the contracts used, so that users can make minor changes to the standard code. For example, the Jetton smart contract allows users to experiment with custom behavior.

4. Create a user-friendly interface that allows users to deploy or run the project without having to download the code or configure anything. Note that this should still be standalone and served from GitHub Pages to run 100% client-side on the user's device. Example: [TON Minter](https://minter.ton.org/).

5. Explain what each field and option means, and outline best practices.

6. Explain key security considerations to help creators avoid dangerous smart contracts, bots, or websites. You must explain enough that creators do not make mistakesâ€”you are teaching them the best security practices.

7. Ideally, the repository should include well-written tests that show the reader how to best implement them in the context of your tutorial.

8. The repository should have its own easy-to-understand compilation/deployment scripts. Users should be able to install and run with one command, e.g., `npm install && npm run <script>`.

9. Sometimes a GitHub repository is enough and there is no need to write a full article. A README with all the necessary code in the repository is sufficient. In this case, the code should be well-commented so that the user can easily read and understand it.
