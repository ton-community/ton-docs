# Content standardization

## Introduction

This guideline aims to maintain a consistent documentation style and help contributors standardize their content so that it seamlessly integrates into the documentation.

## Text preferences

### Use American English

For words that have multiple spellings, use American English over British English.

Examples:

- "decentralized" over "decentralised"
- "color" over "colour"
- "analyze" over "analyse"

### Use active voice

Sentences using active voice are more concise and efficient, making your writing more engaging and easier to comprehend.

**Active voice sentence:** An actor acts on a target

> _"The smart contract processed a message."_

**Passive voice sentence:** A target acts on an actor

> _"The message was processed by the smart contract."_

_This isn't an easy one, especially for non-native English speakers. If you aren't sure, don't worry. We'll help with any of these._

### Grammar

This documentation uses [cspell](https://cspell.org/) to correct grammar during development.

The `cspell` will check the spelling and automatically suggest corrections in case of mistakes before creating a new commit. Feel free to add specific words to the [cspell.json](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-docs/blob/doc_editor_guidelines/cspell.json) config and include them in the verification dictionary.

### Date format

Use the **"Mon D, YYYY"** format. This approach is standard for American readers, spells out the month (or uses a three-letter abbreviation), and minimizes confusion with day–month ordering.

#### Preferred format:

- Nov 2, 2023
- Feb 11, 2023

#### Incorrect format:

- 2-Nov-2023
- 11/2/2023
- 2/11/2023

Adhering to these guidelines creates a unified approach to presenting dates, fostering clarity and comprehension throughout the TON documentation.

## Link preferences

### Linking to internal pages

When linking to another page on TON documentation, use the relative path over the absolute path.

#### Correct link:

```md
Read more about [smart contracts](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/overview/)
```

#### Incorrect link:

```md
Read more about [smart contracts](https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/overview)
```

Don't hard-code the language path (for example, `/mandarin/`) in any links. This maintains consistent capability across different language versions of the site.

#### Correct link:

```md
Read more about [smart contracts](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/overview/)
```

#### Incorrect link:

```md
Read more about [smart contracts](/mandarin/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/overview)
```

Set a trailing slash to all links. This approach keeps links consistent and avoids redirects, which hurts site performance.

#### Correct link:

```md
Read more about [smart contracts](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/overview/)
```

#### Incorrect link:

```md
Read more about [smart contracts](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/overview)
```

### Article authors

When citing articles by a specific author or organization, use the article's name as a link, followed by a dash and the author's name italicized.

#### Correct description:

```md
- [How to shard your TON smart contract and why](https://blog.ton.org/how-to-shard-your-ton-smart-contract-and-why-studying-the-anatomy-of-tons-jettons) — _Tal Kol_
- [TON Teleport BTC Whitepaper](https://tgbtc.gitbook.io/docs/whitepaper/abstract) – _RSquad Blockchain Lab_
```

#### Incorrect description:

```md
- [How to shard your TON smart contract and why](https://blog.ton.org/how-to-shard-your-ton-smart-contract-and-why-studying-the-anatomy-of-tons-jettons)
- [TON Teleport BTC Whitepaper](https://tgbtc.gitbook.io/docs/whitepaper/abstract) by RSquad Blockchain Lab
```

### See also links section

Include related resources on your page in an H2 section titled `## See also`.

This section guides readers to additional materials and supports a cohesive developer journey.

#### Example:

```md
## See also

- [Style guide](/v3/contribute/style-guide/)
- [Typography](/v3/contribute/typography/)
- [Localization program](/v3/contribute/localization-program/overview/)
```

## Image preferences

### Linking to images

When adding an image to a page, download and set an image in the TON documentation `static/img` folder.

#### Correct linking:

```md
![jetton_transfer](/img/docs/asset-processing/jetton_transfer.png)
```

#### Incorrect linking:

```md
![tact_logo](https://docs.tact-lang.org/_astro/logomark-dark.BSmgZYWc_ZKRrUl.svg)
```

This is helpful to ensure the image will be available.

### Light and dark theme modes

TON documentation supports theme-specific images. Follow these steps to add themed pictures to the page.

1. Themed mode is available only for `.mdx` files.

2. Import the `ThemedImage` module in the header.

```js
import ThemedImage from "@theme/ThemedImage";
```

3. Set the links for both images according to the example:

```js
<br></br>
<ThemedImage
  alt=""
  sources={{
    light: '/img/docs/message-delivery/message_delivery_2.svg?raw=true',
    dark: '/img/docs/message-delivery/message_delivery_2_dark.svg?raw=true',
  }}
/>
<br></br>
```

### Annotation specification

To depict message processing, use a graphical representation that resembles a smart contract graph, including labels for transactions and messages.

If the transaction order isn't essential, omit their labels. This approach simplifies the diagram, making it easier to read and understand the message and contract details.

### Annotation primitives

<ThemedImage
  alt=""
  sources={{
    light:
      "/img/docs/scheme-templates/message-processing-graphs/Graphic-Explanations-Guidelines_1.png?raw=true",
    dark: "/img/docs/scheme-templates/message-processing-graphs/Graphic-Explanations-Guidelines_1_dark.png?raw=true",
  }}
/>
<br></br>

- Avoid using a large variety of bright colors.
- Modify figures by applying techniques such as a dashed border.
- To emphasize specific details, display transactions using distinct line styles (e.g., solid and dashed).

### Message processing schemes

On the TON blockchain, providing clear explanations of actor behavior and message processing for various smart contracts and fundamental scenarios is essential.

The message processing schemes offer additional context for readers seeking a clear understanding of actor behavior. These schemes should be unified throughout the TON documentation to ensure maximum clarity.

#### Example

<br></br>
<ThemedImage
  alt=""
  sources={{
    light: "/img/docs/message-delivery/message_delivery_2.png?raw=true",
    dark: "/img/docs/message-delivery/message_delivery_2_dark.png?raw=true",
  }}
/>
<br></br>

### Sequence diagram

Use a sequence diagram for complex and repetitive communication schemes between 2-3 actors. For messages, use the notation of a typical synchronous message arrow.

#### Example

<br></br>
<div class="text--center">
  <ThemedImage
    alt=""
    sources={{
      light: "/img/docs/message-delivery/message_delivery_7.png?raw=true",
      dark: "/img/docs/message-delivery/message_delivery_7_dark.png?raw=true",
    }}
  />
</div>
<br></br>

### Scheme formats and colors

#### Format:

- Use a PNG format for the diagrams in the documentation to ensure readability on various devices.

#### Fonts:

- Use the [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) font family for all text within diagrams.
- Maintain a consistent text size.
- Avoid overusing **bold** and _italic_ formatting for optimal readability.

#### Themed colors for light mode:

- Pencil Hand Drawn, default Visio theme.

#### Themed colors for dark mode:

- Font `#e3e3e3`.
- Background `#232328`.
- Light Highlight, arrows and scheme borders `#058dd2`.
- Dark Highlight, arrows and scheme borders `#0088cc`.
- InnerBackGround, for nested blocks `#333337`.

#### Version control policy:

- Store the original files in the project's Git repository under the `/static/visio` directory to facilitate future modifications.
- Learn [Visio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/visio/flowchart-software) references directly from [Visio sources](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-docs/tree/main/static/schemes-visio/).

## Terminology

### TON

TON should always be capitalized.

**Correct usage:**

- TON

### TON with a word

- It is essential to ensure the correct use of _THE_ in the TON documentation. _TON Blockchain_ and _TON Ecosystem_ are capitalized terms, and therefore, do not require _THE_ in their usage.
- We write _TON_ with regular nouns, and if it requires _THE_ according to English grammar, we use it. For instance: "_The_ TON Connect _protocol_ is a..."

**Correct usage:**

- TON Blockchain
- TON Ecosystem
- The TON Connect protocol

**Correct usage:**

- TON Center

**Incorrect usage:**

- Toncenter
- TonCenter
- TONcenter

### Mainnet

When referring to the TON Mainnet (i.e. not referring to a Testnet) use the proper noun. Proper nouns help avoid confusion and build greater understanding.
