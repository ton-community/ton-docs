If you decide to write a tutorial, see the [TON Bounties program](https://github.com/ton-society/grants-and-bounties) for details on rewards.

## Decide what you want to write

Find or write material you want to cover.
1. Check a [list of issues on TON Docs GitHub](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-docs/issues) with `tutorial` label.
2. Alternatively, propose your own idea on TON Docs GitHub using the [tutorial template](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-docs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature+%3Asparkles%3A%2Ccontent+%3Afountain_pen%3A&template=suggest_tutorial.yaml&title=Suggest+a+tutorial).

## Describe a problem to get a reward

Create a TON Footsteps issue to request funding for your contribution.
1. Read about the [TON Bounties](https://github.com/ton-society/grants-and-bounties/blob/main/bounties/BOUNTIES_PROGRAM_GUIDELINES.md) program in more detail.
    1. **TL;DR:** Use the [Improve TVM Instructions article](https://github.com/ton-society/grants-and-bounties/issues/361) as an example.
