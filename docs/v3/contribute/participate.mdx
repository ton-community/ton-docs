If you decide to write tutorial, you can get some reward for outstanding materials:

Let's see how you can participate in contributing process.

## Decide what you want to write

Find or write a material which you want to describe.
1. Check a [list of issues on TON Docs GitHub](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-docs/issues) with `tutorial` label.
2. _OR_ write your own idea on TON Docs GitHub with [tutorial template](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-docs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature+%3Asparkles%3A%2Ccontent+%3Afountain_pen%3A&template=suggest_tutorial.yaml&title=Suggest+a+tutorial).

## Describe a problem to get a reward

Write a _ton-footstep_ to receive a funding for your contributing.
1. Read about [TON Footsteps](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps) program in more detail.
    1. **TLDR:** Use [Improve TVM Instructions article](https://github.com/ton-society/grants-and-bounties/issues/361) as an example.
2. Write [your own TON Footsteps task](https://github.com/ton-society/ton-footsteps/issues/new/choose) to participate and wait for approve. [TON Footsteps Helper Bot](https://t.me/footsteps_helper_bot) will help you.
3. After received `approved` label start to write your tutorial.

## Writing a tutorial
