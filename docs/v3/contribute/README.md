## Contribute rules

### Documentation maintain community

TON Documentation is entirely open source. Community enthusiasts and early TON contributors have played a key role in creating this open-source TON documentation by turning their notes into detailed pages.

It was initially written by TON [contributors](/v3/contribute/maintainers/) and supported by [TON Studio](https://tonstudio.io/).
We aim to educate users about TON through explicit, easily searchable content that appeals to technical experts and casual readers.

### Development

- Learn the documentation development flow from a [ton-docs/README.md](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-docs?tab=readme-ov-file#set-up-your-environment-%EF%B8%8F) document.

#### Best practice for pull request

1. **Keep your pull request small**. Minor pull requests (~300 lines of diff) are easier to review and more likely to get merged. Make sure the pull request does only one thing; otherwise, please split it.
2. **Use descriptive titles**. It would be best to follow the commit message style.
3. **Test your changes**. Run build locally, and make sure you have no crushes.
4. **Use soft wrap**: Don't wrap lines at 80 characters; configure your editor to soft-wrap.
