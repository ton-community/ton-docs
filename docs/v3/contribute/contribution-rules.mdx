Before contributing to TON documentation, review the following general requirements to ensure a smooth experience.

## Naming

- Use “the” correctly in TON documentation. “TON Blockchain” and “TON Ecosystem” are proper names and do not take the definite article.
- Use “TON” with common nouns; when English grammar requires the definite article, include “the” (e.g., “The TON Connect protocol is …”).
