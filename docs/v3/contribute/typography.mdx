# Typography

## Introduction
This standard ensures a consistent and professional style across TON documentation. 

Following these guidelines, you help maintain clarity, enhance readability, and support easy navigation in the documentation site and any associated menus.

---

## File names
- **Naming convention:** Use **kebab-case** - all lowercase, words separated by hyphens.
- **Example:** `kebab-case-file-name.md`
- **Purpose:** Kebab-case is SEO-friendly, easy to read, and helps avoid naming conflicts or issues in case-sensitive file systems.

## Documents typography

### General text style
- Write concise, clear sentences.
- Use simple, direct language suitable for both new and experienced users.
- Avoid overly complex structures; aim for clarity and brevity.
- Avoid excessive use of bold or italic styles.
- All graphic elements containing text should use the [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) or a similarly compatible font.


### Acronyms

When introducing an unfamiliar acronym, spell the entire term and put the abbreviation in parentheses. Put both the full term and acronym in bold.

**Example:**

**The Open Network (TON)** is a decentralized and open internet platform...

### Headers

#### Header hierarchy:
1. **H1 (`#`)** – Document title
2. **H2 (`##`)** – Major sections
3. **H3 (`###`)** – Subsections under H2
4. **H4 (`####`)** and below – Use sparingly for finer detail

#### Header capitalization style:
- **H1, H2, H3 and H4:** **Sentence case**
  - Example: `# This sentence is in sentence case`
  - Example: `## This sentence is in sentence case`
  - Example: `### This sentence is in sentence case`
  - Example: `### This sentence is in sentence case`


- **Exception**: **Special terms**.
Despite the overall _sentence case_ rule,
  certain words or phrases—key concepts or defined terms within the documentation—must always be formatted
  using the title case.
  - Example: `## Use American English`
  - Example: `# Run the TON Center service`

#### Header consistency:
- Avoid repeating the exact words in consecutive headers.

#### Header formatting:

Use plain text for all headers.
Avoid using any formatting styles in headings:

- No code formatting `backticks` (``)
- No bold **text**
- No italics *text*
- No quotation marks (“ ” or " ")
- No ALL CAPS (unless it's an acronym)

Keep headers clean and consistent. Use formatting only in body text.

**Correct:**

- Run the TON Center service
- How the smart contract works

**Incorrect:**

- *Run the TON Center service*
- How the `smart contract` works
- “Run the TON Center service”
- HOW THE SMART CONTRACT WORKS


#### Capitalized terms in headers

Sometimes, you can face specific capitalization defined as capitalized according to American English rules.

- Capitalization standard for specific terms:
- Example: `## Use American English`
- Example: `### Date Format`
  
Date and Format are special terms and should be capitalized, regardless of the overall Sentence Case rule.

### Avoid "quotation marks"
Do not use "quotation marks" to highlight terms, variables, or functions. Instead, apply **bold** for terms and `code formatting` for code references.

**Correct usage:**
- Use **get_wallet_address** when introducing a term.
- Use `get_wallet_address` when referencing a code variable or function.

**Incorrect usage:**
- Do not use "get_wallet_address" for a term, code variable, or function.


### Navigation menu headings
The navigation menus should remain minimalistic in both the left sidebar and the top menu. For consistency and clarity, all menu headings must use Sentence case.

#### Left sidebar menu:
- Avoid lengthy descriptions.
- Use short, clear labels of two or three words.

:::info
Specify the left side menu with [sidebars](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-docs/tree/main/sidebars) configuration files.
:::

#### Navigation bar menu:
- Set only high-level hierarchy pages in this menu.
- Use broad, descriptive terms to categorize content, ensuring users can quickly identify the main section they need.

:::info
Specify the navigation bar menu with the [navbar.js](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-docs/blob/main/navbar.js) configuration file.
:::

#### Consistency between menu and in-page headers
- Match the header text used in the table of contents or side menu with the header text in the article, ensuring readers know they're on the correct page or section.

## Putting it all together
1. **Create your new documentation file** using the kebab-case naming convention
   * Example:`getting-started-guide.md`.
2. **Open the file** and set an H1 heading in sentence case
   * Example: `# Getting started guide`.
3. **Organize content** with H2 headings for main topics 
   * Example:`## Installation steps`, also in sentence case.
4. **Use H3 headings** for more detailed subtopics in sentence case 
   * Example: `### Installing on Linux`).
5. **Maintain consistency** in any side menus or tables of contents by matching the header text from within the document.
