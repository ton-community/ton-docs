# Typography

## Introduction

This standard ensures a consistent and professional style across TON documentation.

By following these guidelines, you help maintain clarity, enhance readability, and support easy navigation in the documentation site and any associated menus.

---

## File names

- **Naming convention:** Use **kebab-case** - all lowercase, words separated by hyphens.
- **Example:** `kebab-case-file-name.md`
- **Purpose:** Kebab-case is SEO-friendly, easy to read, and helps avoid naming conflicts or issues in case-sensitive file systems.

## Document typography

### General text style

- Write concise, clear sentences.
- Use simple, direct language suitable for both new and experienced users.
- Avoid overly complex structures; aim for clarity and brevity.
- Avoid excessive use of bold or italic styles.
- All graphic elements containing text should use the [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) or a similarly compatible font.

### Acronyms

When introducing an unfamiliar acronym, spell the entire term and put the abbreviation in parentheses. Put both the full term and acronym in bold.

**Example:**

**The Open Network (TON)** is a decentralized and open internet platform...

### Headers

#### Header hierarchy:

1. **H1 (`#`)** – Document title
2. **H2 (`##`)** – Major sections
3. **H3 (`###`)** – Subsections under H2
4. **H4 (`####`)** and below – Use sparingly for finer detail

#### Header capitalization style:

- **H1, H2, H3 and H4:** **Sentence case**
  - Example: `# This sentence is in sentence case`
  - Example: `## This sentence is in sentence case`
  - Example: `### This sentence is in sentence case`
  - Example: `#### This sentence is in sentence case`

- Headers use sentence case. Capitalize only proper nouns and defined terms.
  - Example: `## Use American English`
  - Example: `# Run the TON Center service`

#### Header consistency:

- Avoid repeating the exact words in consecutive headers.

#### Header formatting:

Use plain text for all headers.
Avoid using any formatting styles in headings:

- No code formatting using backticks (&#96;)
- No bold **text**
- No italics _text_
- No quotation marks (“ ” or " ")
- No ALL CAPS (unless it's an acronym)

Keep headers clean and consistent. Use formatting only in body text.

**Correct:**

- Run the TON Center service
- How the smart contract works

**Incorrect:**

- _Run the TON Center service_
- How the `smart contract` works
- “Run the TON Center service”
- HOW THE SMART CONTRACT WORKS

#### Capitalized terms in headers

Some terms are defined as proper nouns and should be capitalized according to American English rules.

- Example: `## Use American English`
- Example: `### Date format`

### Avoid quotation marks

Do not use "quotation marks" to highlight terms, variables, or functions. Instead, apply **bold** for terms and `code formatting` for code references.

**Correct usage:**

- Use **smart contract** when introducing a term.
- Use `get_wallet_address` when referencing a code variable or function.

**Incorrect usage:**

- Do not use "get_wallet_address" for a term, code variable, or function.

### Navigation menu headings

The navigation menus should remain minimalistic in both the left sidebar and the navbar. For consistency and clarity, all menu headings must use sentence case.

#### Left sidebar menu:

- Avoid lengthy descriptions.
- Use short, clear labels of two or three words.

:::info
Specify the left sidebar with [sidebars](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-docs/tree/main/sidebars) configuration files.
:::

#### Navbar

- Set only high-level hierarchy pages in this menu.
- Use broad, descriptive terms to categorize content, ensuring users can quickly identify the main section they need.

:::info
Specify the navbar with the [navbar.js](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-docs/blob/main/navbar.js) configuration file.
:::

#### Consistency between menu and in-page headers

- Match the header text used in the left sidebar or table of contents with the header text in the article, ensuring readers know they're on the correct page or section.

## Putting it all together

1. **Create your new documentation file** using the kebab-case naming convention
   - Example: `getting-started-guide.md`.
2. **Open the file** and set an H1 heading in sentence case
   - Example: `# Getting started guide`.
3. **Organize content** with H2 headings for main topics
   - Example: `## Installation steps`, also in sentence case.
4. **Use H3 headings** for more detailed subtopics in sentence case
   - Example: `### Installing on Linux`.
5. **Maintain consistency** in any side menus or tables of contents by matching the header text from within the document.
