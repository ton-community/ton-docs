## Bag of Cells

Bag of Cells (BoC) is a format for serializing cells into byte arrays, which is further described in the [TL-B schema](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/24dc184a2ea67f9c47042b4104bbb4d82289fac1/crypto/tl/boc.tlb#L25).

<br></br>

On TON, everything consists of cells, including contract code, stored data, blocks, achieving streamline and robust flexibility in the process.

### Cell serialization
Let's analyze our first example of a Bag of Cells :

```json
1[8_] -> {
  24[0AAAAA],
  7[FE] -> {
    24[0AAAAA]
  }
}
```
In this example we have a 1-bit size root cell that has 2 links: the first to a 24-bit cell and the second to a 7-bit cell which possesses 1 link to a 24-bit cell.

For this framework to work as intended, it’s necessary to turn the cells into a single sequence of bytes. To accomplish this, first, we leverage only unique cell types, below 3 out of 4 are presented as follows:
```json
1[8_]
24[0AAAAA]
7[FE]
```
:::note
In order to leave only unique cells they need to be compared. To do this, we need to compare the [hashes](#cell-hash) of the cells.
:::
Now let's arrange them in such an order that the parent cells do not point backwards. The cell pointed to by the rest must be in the list after the ones that point to it. We get:
```json
1[8_]      -> index 0 (root cell)
7[FE]      -> index 1
24[0AAAAA] -> index 2
```

Now, let's calculate descriptions for each of the 3 cells touched on above. These descriptions are made up of 2 bytes that store flags composed of information about the length of the data and the number of data linkages. 

The first byte - **refs descriptor** - is calculated as `r+8s+32l`, where `0 ≤ r ≤ 4` is amount of the Cell references (links), `0 ≤ s ≤ 1` is 1 for [exotic](#special-exotic-cells) cells and 0 for ordinary ones, and `0 ≤ l ≤ 3` is the [level](#cell-level) of the Cell.

The second one - **bits descriptor** - is equals `floor(b / 8) + ceil (b / 8)` where `0 <= b <= 1023` is number of bits in the Cell. This descriptor represents the length of the full 4-bit groups of the Cell data (but at least 1 if it isn’t empty).

The result is:

```json
1[8_]      -> 0201 -> 2 refs, length 1
7[FE]      -> 0101 -> 1 ref, length 1
24[0AAAAA] -> 0006 -> 0 refs, length 6
```
For data with incomplete 4-bit groups, 1 bit is added to the end of the sequence. This means it denotes the end bit of the group and is used to determine the true size of incomplete groups. Let's add the bits below:


```json
1[8_]      -> C0     -> 0b10000000->0b11000000
7[FE]      -> FF     -> 0b11111110->0b11111111
24[0AAAAA] -> 0AAAAA -> do not change (full groups)
```

Now let's add the refs indexes:
```json
0 1[8_]      -> 0201 -> refers to 2 cells with such indexes
1 7[FE]      -> 02 -> refers to cells with index 2
2 24[0AAAAA] -> no refs
```

And put it all together:
```json
0201 C0     0201  
0101 AA     02
0006 0AAAAA 
```

And concat it by joining the corresponding strings into a single array of bytes: 
`0201c002010101ff0200060aaaaa`, size 14 bytes.

ceilBytes := c.bitsSz / 8

}

	// calc size

	specBit := byte(0)
	if c.special {
		specBit = 8
	}

	return []byte{byte(len(c.refs)) + specBit + c.level*32, byte(ln)}
}
```

### Packing a Bag of Cells
Let's pack the cell from the section directly above. We have already serialized it into a flat 14 byte array.

Therefore, we build the header according to its [schema](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/24dc184a2ea67f9c47042b4104bbb4d82289fac1/crypto/tl/boc.tlb#L25).

```
b5ee9c72                      -> id tl-b of the BoC structure
01                            -> flags and size:(## 3), in our case the flags are all 0,
                                 and the number of bytes needed to store the number of cells is 1.
                                 we get - 0b0_0_0_00_001
01                            -> number of bytes to store the size of the serialized cells
03                            -> number of cells, 1 byte (defined by 3 bits size:(## 3), equal to 3.
01                            -> number of root cells - 1
00                            -> absent, always 0 (in current implementations)
0e                            -> size of serialized cells, 1 byte (size defined above), equal to 14
00                            -> root cell index, size 1 (determined by 3 size:(## 3) bits from header),
                                 always 0
0201c002010101ff0200060aaaaa  -> serialized cells
```

Next, we concat everything above into an array of bytes into our final BoC:
`b5ee9c7201010301000e000201c002010101ff0200060aaaaa`

## Special (Exotic) Cells

Generally, cells operating on TON are divided into two main types: ordinary cells and special cells. Most of the cells that the users work with are ordinary cells responsible for carrying information. 

Nevertheless, to realize internal functionality of the network, special cells are sometimes needed and are used for a diverse range of purposes, depending on their subtype.

Special cell subtypes are determined by the first 8 bits that form their data structures. The main subtype variations include:

```js
0x01: PrunnedBranch
0x02: Library
0x03: MerkleProof
0x04: MerkleUpdate
```

## Cell Level

Every Cell has an attribute called `Level`, which is represented by an integer from 0 to 3.

### Ordinary cells level

The Level of an ordinary Cell is always equal to the maximum of the levels of all its references:
```cpp
Lvl(c) = max [Lvl(r_0), ..., Lvl(r_i)] where i is a 'c' reference amount
```
_Ordinary Cell without refs level is zero_

### Exotic cells level
Exotic cells have different rules for setting their level, which are described in [this](/develop/data-formats/exotic-cells) article.

## Cell hash
In most cases users work with ordinary cells with level 0 which have only one hash, called representation hash (or hash infinity).

Cell `c` with level `Lvl(c) = l`, where `1 ≤ l ≤ 3` has representation hash and `l` **"higher"** hashes.

### Standard Cell representation hash calculation
First, we need to calculate Cell representation (which is similar to Cell serialization described above)

1. Compute descriptors bytes
2. Add serialized Cell data
3. For every Cell's refs add its depth
4. For every Cell's refs add its representation hash
5. Compute SHA256 hash of the result

Let's analyze the following examples:

#### Cell without references
```json
32[0000000F]
```
1. Descriptors computation

The reference descriptor is equals to `r+8s+32l = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 = 00`

The bits descriptor is equals to `floor(b / 8) + ceil (b / 8) = 8 = 08`

Concatenating these bytes we get `0008`

2. Cell data serialization

In this case we have complete 4-bit groups, so we don't have to add any bits to the Cell data. The result is `0000000f`

3. Refs depth

We skip this part, because our Cell doesn't have any refs

4. Refs hashes

We skip this part, because our Cell doesn't have any refs

5. SHA256 computation

Concatenating bytes from the previous steps we get `00080000000f` and the SHA256 from this bytestring is `57b520dbcb9d135863fc33963cde9f6db2ded1430d88056810a2c9434a3860f9` - that's the Cell representation hash.

#### Cell with references
```json
24[00000B] -> {
	32[0000000F],
	32[0000000F]
}
```

1. Descriptors computation

The reference descriptor is equals to `r+8s+32l = 2 + 0 + 0 = 0 = 02`

The bits descriptor is equals to `floor(b / 8) + ceil (b / 8) = 6 = 06`

Concatenating these bytes we get `0206`

2. Cell data serialization

In this case we have complete 4-bit groups, so we don't have to add any bits to the Cell data. The result is `00000b`

3. Refs depth

The depth is represented by 2 bytes. Our Cell has 2 refs and depth of each is zero so the result of this step is `00000000`.

4. Refs hashes

For every reference we add its hash (we computed above), so the result is `57b520dbcb9d135863fc33963cde9f6db2ded1430d88056810a2c9434a3860f957b520dbcb9d135863fc33963cde9f6db2ded1430d88056810a2c9434a3860f9`

5. SHA256 computation

Concatenating bytes from the previous steps we get `020600000b0000000057b520dbcb9d135863fc33963cde9f6db2ded1430d88056810a2c9434a3860f957b520dbcb9d135863fc33963cde9f6db2ded1430d88056810a2c9434a3860f9`
and the SHA256 from this bytestring is `f345277cc6cfa747f001367e1e873dcfa8a936b8492431248b7a3eeafa8030e7` - that's the Cell representation hash.

### Higher hashes calculation

Higher hashes of an Ordinary Cell `c` are computed similarly to its representation hash,
but using the higher hashes of its references instead of their representation hashes.

Exotic cells have their own rules for computing their higher hashes, which are described in [this](/develop/data-formats/exotic-cells) article.

### Merkle Proof
Merkle Proof cells are actually a hash tree that is used to cryptographically verify (via the merkle proof) that a portion of the cell tree data belongs to the full tree. This design often prevents the verifier from knowing the full contents of the tree, while only revealing its root hash.

Within itself, a cell carries the root hash of an object (for example, a block) and a hash tree of its branches as a child cell. The internal tree itself repeats the structure of the original object (by cryptographically proving its integrity), but at the same time, all branches that are not part of the data and don’t need verification and don’t lead to it are replaced by special `PrunnedBranch` cells, which instead of storing data, store the cell’s individualized hash.

Therefore, having calculated the root hash of the entire tree, the same hash should be derived from the root cell data of the merkle proof, which should match the hash known to us in advance (e.g., the hash of a block). This approach allows us to prove, for example, the existence of a transaction in a block, provided that the party knows the hash of the block in the first place.

#### Proof example for getAccountState
The getAccountState is a proof used to verify the integrity of the [ShardStateUnsplit](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/master/crypto/block/block.tlb#L399) structure. But instead of the whole block, the getAccountState proof contains only the requested account:  `EQCVRJ-RqeZWcDqgTzzcxUIrChFYs0SyKGUvye9kGOuEWndQ`. 

All branches that are not related to or leading to the getAccountState are replaced with a `PrunnedBranch`, and those leading to it are `Ordinary` cells and contain the actual block data.

The symbol `*` denotes a special cell, the root which uses the 0x03 denotes a MerkleProof, while the 0x01 denotes a PrunedBranch.
