# IDE Support

The [intellij-ton](https://github.com/andreypfau/intellij-ton) plugin supports the Fift and FunC programming languages
as well as the typed language binary (TL-B) format.

Additionally, the correct TL-B syntax specifications are described in
the [TlbParser.bnf](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/intellij-ton/blob/main/src/main/grammar/TlbParser.bnf) file.
