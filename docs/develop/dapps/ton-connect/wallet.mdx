# Connect a Wallet

If you are a wallet developer, you can connect your wallet to TON Connect and enable your users to interact with TON apps in a secure and convenient way.

## Integration

Use the following steps to connect your wallet to TON Connect:

1. Read carefully [Protocol specifications](/develop/dapps/ton-connect/protocol/).
2. Implement the protocol using one of the [SDKs](/develop/dapps/ton-connect/developers).
3. Add your wallet to the [wallets-list](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/wallets-list) with a pull request.
