# Api keys

## Overview

When using the TON HTTP API, a `token` (`key`) is generally not required. However, it unlocks request limitations. There are several available plans:

| Name       | Request Limitation  | Price           | Features                                      |
|------------|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| No token   | 1 per 4 sec         | Free            | -                                             |
| Free       | 10 per 1 sec        | Free            | More requests for free                        |
| Plus       | 25 per 1 sec        | 2.5 TON/month   | Privately hosted, highly reliable Liteservers |
| Advanced   | 100 per 1 sec       | 25 TON/month    | Privately hosted, highly reliable Liteservers |
| Dedicated  | Unlimited           | 590 TON/month   | Dedicated Toncenter Infrastructure            |
