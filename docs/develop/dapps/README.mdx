# Getting Started
Before diving into DApps, make sure you understand the underlying blockchain principles. You might find our [The Open Network](/learn/introduction) and [Blockchain of Blockchains](/learn/overviews/ton-blockchain) articles useful.

TON DApps are applications without backend, which interact with the blockchain. In most cases, they interact with custom [smart contracts](/develop/smart-contracts/); this documentation provides ways to process standard assets available in TON, both as an example and for quicker DApps development.

DApps generally can be written in any programming language having SDK for TON. Actually, the most frequent choice is a website, followed by Telegram mini-apps.

## TON Course: DApps

:::tip
Before starting the course, make sure you have a good understanding of the basics of blockchain technology. If you have gaps in your knowledge, we recommend taking the [Blockchain Basics with TON](https://stepik.org/course/201294/promo) ([RU version](https://stepik.org/course/202221/), [CHN version](https://stepik.org/course/200976/)) course.
Module 3 covers the basic knowledge of Dapp.
:::

The [TON Blockchain Course](https://stepik.org/course/176754/) is a comprehensive guide to TON Blockchain development.

Module 5 and 6 completely covers DApps development. You'll learn how to create a DApp, how to work with TON Connect, how to use SDKs and how to work with the blockchain.
