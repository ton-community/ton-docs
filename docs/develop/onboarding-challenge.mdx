### Mining on TON Blockchain

Today, we are going to teach our prospective builders how to mine on TON Blockchain. This experience will allow all of you to understand the significance of mining and why Bitcoin mining helped revolutionize the industry.

Though the PoW Giver smart contract framework that defined the initial mining process that helped lay the foundation for TON was completed at launch, the last TON was mined in June of 2022 to culminate TON’s Proof of Work (PoW) token distribution mechanism. That said, with our recent transition to Proof of Stake (PoS), the era of staking on TON has just begun.

* [Dive deeper into our economic model and mining on TON](https://ton.org/mining)


Now, let’s focus on the first steps to becoming a **TVM Developer** and learn how to mine an NFT on TON! Provided below is an example of what we're aiming to create.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <video style={{ borderRadius: '10pt', margin: '15pt auto', maxWidth: '90%' }} muted={true} autoPlay={true}
         loop={true}>
    <source src="/files/onboarding.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
  </video>
</div>

It’s possible to create a miner in about half an hour if we keep focused on the task at hand.

## 🦄 Getting started

To get started, all developers will make use of the following components:

* __Wallet__: You need a non-custodial wallet to store an NFT in testnet mode.
* __Repository__:  We’ll use a ready-made template designed specifically for you.
* __Developer Environment__:  Developers will need to determine whether they want to mine using a local or cloud environment.

### Download and Create a Wallet

To start off, you’ll need a non-custodial wallet that will allow you to receive and store your TON; for this purpose in this guide we are using Tonkeeper. You’ll need to enable Testnet mode within the wallet to be able to receive Testnet Toncoins. These tokens will be used later on to send a final minting transaction to the smart contract.

:::info
With a non-custodial wallet, the user owns the wallet and holds its private key by themself.
:::

To download and create a TON wallet follow these simple steps:

1. Install the Tonkeeper app on your smartphone. It can be downloaded [here](https://tonkeeper.com/).
2. Next, you’ll need to [enable test mode](/participate/wallets/apps#tonkeeper-test-environment) within the Tonkeeper.

Easy! Let's go to the development now.

### Project setup

To make your life easier and skip routine low-level stuff, we will use a boilerplate.

:::info
Note, you need to [sign in](https://github.com/login) to GitHub for further work.
:::

Please, use the [ton-onboarding-challenge](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-onboarding-challenge) template to create your project by clicking on the “Use this template” button and selecting the “Create a new repository” tab as shown below:

<ConceptImage src="/img/tutorials/onboarding/1.png" />

After completing this step, you’ll have access to a highly performant repository that can be used as your miner's core. Congratulations! ✨

### Development Environments

The next step is to choose which developer environment is best suited to your needs, experience level, and overall skill-set. As you can see, it is possible to carry out this process by using either a cloud-based or local environment. Developing on the cloud is often considered simpler and easier to get started. Below, we’ll outline the steps required for both approaches.

#### Local and Cloud Development Environments

* For users unfamiliar with JavaScript, it is not usually possible to leverage a JavaScript IDE, especially if your computer and tooling systems are not tailored to using such an approach. It is often faster and more efficient to use a **cloud environment**for development. Cloud environments are often free and readily available on GitHub for anyone to use with a few simple clicks.

* However, if you're familiar with NodeJS and Git and know how to work with `npm`, it may be more comfortable for you to use a **local environment**.

#### Cloud Codespaces

If you choose the cloud development environment it's easy to get started by first selecting the _Code_ tab and then by clicking on the _Create codespace on master_ button within the GitHub repository like shown below:

<ConceptImage src="/img/tutorials/onboarding/2.png" />

After completing this step, GitHub will create a special cloud workspace that allows you to access the VSCode Online IDE (Visual Code Online Integrated Development Environment).

After this access is granted (it takes about 30  seconds for the terminal to install) you'll have everything you need to get started without needing to install Git, Node.js, or other developer tools.

#### Local Development Environments

To begin using a local development environment you’ll need access to 3 main tools. These include:

- **Git**: Git is an essential tool that every developer needs to work with repositories. It can be downloaded [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **NodeJS**: Node.js is the JavaScript and TypeScript runtime environment typically used for application development on TON. It can be downloaded [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- **JavaScript IDE**. JavaScript IDE’s are typically used for development within local development environments. An example of this case is Visual Studio Code ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)).

To get started you’ll clone your GitHub repository boilerplate and open the correct repository in your Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

Great! After these steps you're ready to get deeper into TON Blockchain secrets. 👀

## 🎯 Connect to TON

Okay, what do you need to connect to TON Blockchain?

* __Smart contract address__ as a point of destination. Our goal is to mine an NFT from the _proof-of-work smart contract_, so we need an address to get current mining complexity.
* __API provider__ to make requests to TON Blockchain. TON has multiple [API types](/develop/dapps/apis/) for different purposes. We will use the testnet version of [toncenter.com](https://toncenter.com/) API.
* __JavaScript SDK__: A JavaScript SDK (recall that an SDK is a software development kit) is needed to parse the smart contract address being used and prepare it to create an API request. To better understand TON addresses and why they need to be parsed to carry out this process, please see this [resource](/learn/overviews/addresses) to understand why we should parse it. To carry out this procedure the [ton.js](https://github.com/ton-core/ton) will be used.

In the next section we’ll describe how users send their initial requests to TON Bblockchain using the toncenter API and ton.js to receive data from the PoW smart contract.

### Smart Contract Addresses

For the miner to work correctly, we need to add two different smart contract address types. These include:

1. __Wallet address__: A wallet address is required because it is necessary for the miner to receive their mining reward (in this case, we must use the [Tonkeeper Testnet mode](/participate/wallets/apps#tonkeeper-test-environment)).
2. __Collection address__: A collection address is required to act as a smart contract to correctly mine an NFT (to carry out this process copy the NFT collection address, under the TON unboarding challenge collection name from the [Getgems website](https://testnet.getgems.io/collection/EQDk8N7xM5D669LC2YACrseBJtDyFqwtSPCNhRWXU7kjEptX)).

Next, we’ll open the `index.ts` file in your miner and create a main function composed of initial constants as follows:


```ts title="ton-onboarding-challenge/index.ts"
import {Address} from "ton"

async function main () {

  const wallet = Address.parse('YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS');
  const collection = Address.parse('COLLECTION_ADDRESS');

}

main()
```

#### Using the async main() Function

Later in the process of creating a TON NFT Miner, several requests will be executed to the public API to relay responses to the correct string of code in exchange for the desired instructions. By leveraging the Async/await function, code simplicity is improved dramatically.

#### Address Parsing

On TON, smart contract addresses come in different forms that employ the use of numerous flag types. In this context specifically, we’ll make use of the _user-friendly address form_. That said, if you are curious to learn more about the different smart contract address types, feel free to check out this additional [resource](https://ton.org/docs/learn/overviews/addresses) in our documentation.

For the miner to work correctly, we need to add two different smart contract address types. These include:

The `Address.parse()` command found in the `ton.js` SDK allows the developer to create an address object to convert addresses from one form to another in a simplified manner.

### Connect to an API Provider

To continue the process, we'll need to connect to a specific API provider called the TonCenter API provider (which is hosted on [toncenter.com](https://toncenter.com)).

The simplest way to learn is by using `@orbs-network/ton-access`

:::info
Remember, if you are adding new modules with `import`, that You may need to install them by executing the command `npm i @orbs-network/ton-access`.
:::

Using the `ton.js`, we’ll execute a series of code using the
With `ton.js`, we will use _TonClient_ and _getHttpEndpoint_:

```ts title="ton-onboarding-challenge/index.ts"
import {Address, TonClient} from "ton"
import {getHttpEndpoint} from "@orbs-network/ton-access";

  // ... previous code

  // get the decentralized RPC endpoint
  const endpoint = await getHttpEndpoint();

  // initialize ton library
  const client = new TonClient({ endpoint });

```


:::info what to do in production?
It's better to use an RPC node provider or to run your own ton-http-api instance for that. Read more at the [TonCenter API page](/develop/dapps/apis/toncenter).
:::

### Receiving Mining Data From TON Blockchain

Finally, the next step in the process is to retrieve specific mining data from TON Blockchain.

By consulting the [README file](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-onboarding-challenge#mining-process-advanced) needed to complete the ton-onboarding-challenge, the latest TON mining data is obtained by running the `get_mining_data` method. Once initiated, the result will be as follows:

As a result we should receive an array with these fields:

```bash
(
	int pow_complexity,
	int last_success,
	int seed,
	int target_delta,
	int min_cpl,
	int max_cpl
)
```

#### Running Smart Contract Get Methods on TON

Using `ton.js` it is possible to run the callGetMethod (SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS, METHOD) function.
Running this code will result in the following console output:


```ts title="ton-onboarding-challenge/index.ts"
  // ... previous code

  const miningData = await client.callGetMethod(collection, 'get_mining_data')

  console.log(miningData)
```

Furthermore, to run the script, it is necessary to enter the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm run start
```

Good! As long as the above processes were executed correctly, successful connection to the API will be achieved and the necessary data will be received within the console. The correct console output should be initiated as follows:

```bash
{
  gas_used: 2374,
  stack: [
    [
      'num',
      '0x2880000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'
    ],
    [ 'num', '0x63984815' ],
    [ 'num', '0x357401cf9b4f2386950faefd6b616264' ],
    [ 'num', '0x1e' ],
    [ 'num', '0xab' ],
    [ 'num', '0xfc' ]
  ]
}
```

Above it displays the gas amount used to execute the process as well as the sum of numerical (_num_) values in hex format. At this time, this data is not too critical because it is necessary to convert the hex output data into something that can be used more easily.

We need to convert the hex output to something _useful_.

:::GAS PARAMETERS ON TON:
__Warning__: Though this information is highly complex and __not necessary for this tutorial__, if you’re interested in understanding the complex technical aspects of TON consider using these resources:
1. To obtain a better understanding of how TON Virtual Machine (TVM) operates and _how transactions on TON work_, check out [TVM overview section](/learn/tvm-instructions/tvm-overview).
2. Secondly, if you are interested in learning more about how transaction and gas fees work on TON, consider diving into [this section](/develop/smart-contracts/fees) of our documentation.
3. Finally, to get a better understanding of the exact gas values needed to carry out TVM instructions see [this section](/learn/tvm-instructions/instructions#11-gas-prices) of our documentation.
:::

Now, let's return to the tutorial!

#### Numerical Mining Data in a User-Friendly Format

Ok, now we must convert `hex` numbers to something that we can understand and use.

But we have a problem here. As you see with your output, even hex numbers are pretty big. We can't just move them to the variable and use it, because of [JavaScript limitations](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/307179/what-is-javascripts-highest-integer-value-that-a-number-can-go-to-without-losin#:~:text=Note%20that%20the%20bitwise%20operators,31%2D1%2C%20or%202%2C147%2C483%2C647.).

That's why we need `bn.js`. It's a library to work with Big Numbers, that are bigger than maximum JavaScript integer values. Use this example to see the _Mining Data_:

```ts title="ton-onboarding-challenge/index.ts"
import {BN} from 'bn.js'

  // ... previous code

  const parseStackNum = (sn: any) => new BN(sn[1].substring(2), 'hex');

  const complexity = parseStackNum(miningData.stack[0]);
  const last_success = parseStackNum(miningData.stack[1]);
  const seed = parseStackNum(miningData.stack[2]);
  const target_delta = parseStackNum(miningData.stack[3]);
  const min_cpl = parseStackNum(miningData.stack[4]);
  const max_cpl = parseStackNum(miningData.stack[5]);

  console.log('complexity', complexity);
  console.log('last_success', last_success.toString());
  console.log('seed', seed);
  console.log('target_delta', target_delta.toString());
  console.log('min_cpl', min_cpl.toString());
  console.log('max_cpl', max_cpl.toString());
```

As you see, _miningData_ is a stack array with hex numbers. To get the values, we added `parseStackNum` function that creates a _BN_ object from hex number.

After that we try to print values in console. Some values are printed as BN, as it will make it more user-friendly for us. Try to run the script again with command:

```bash
npm run start
```

#### What do you see in console?

Here is an example output:

```bash
complexity <BN: 2880000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000>
last_success 1670924309
seed <BN: 357401cf9b4f2386950faefd6b616264>
target_delta 30
min_cpl 171
max_cpl 252
```

Let's cover the Mining Data deeper to understand the concepts behind mining:

* `complexity` is the most important number for miners. It's a Proof-of-Work complexity for the values. You're successful _if the final hash is less than complexity_.
* `last_success` is a unixtime of the last mining transaction. Every time last_success changes you need to run the miner again, because the seed changes too.
* `seed` is a unique value generated by a smart contract to calculate a hash. If you're interested in how the seed changes, search in the project files with `ctx_seed` keyword.
* `target_delta`, `min_cpl` and `max_cpl` won't be used in our tutorial. But you can always read more about how they are used in smart contracts to calculate proof-of-work complexity in the source files of the collection in your project.

That's it! Now we have the values which we will use in our NFT Miner in the next chapter.

## 🛠 Prepare an NFT Miner

Hey, you did a great job! You are already connected to TON and got the necessary mining data from TON Blockchain to write a true NFT Miner. We are almost done here.

In this chapter you will _prepare a mining message_ and _calculate a hash_ of the message. After that, you will _find a hash that's less than the complexity_ we got from the smart contract.

That is what a miner is! Simple, isn't it?

### Prepare a Mining Message

Ok, what message do we need? What data do we need to send?

Luckily, [README file](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-onboarding-challenge#mining-process-advanced) already has the answers to these questions! You can see a __table__ with fields and types of "proof of work Cell". It looks like an array. There are many fields there!

:::info what is a cell?
A cell is an essential data structure in TON. It works with bits to make transactions fast. But we won't go so low-level here. Read more in the [Cells](/learn/overviews/cells) article if you're interested.
:::

Luckily for you again, all the data structures have already been written with TypeScript for this tutorial. Use a `MineMessageParams` object from _NftGiver.data.ts_ to build a transaction with _Queries_:

```ts title="ton-onboarding-challenge/index.ts"
  import {unixNow} from "./src/lib/utils";
  import {MineMessageParams, Queries} from "./src/giver/NftGiver.data";

  // ... previous code

  const mineParams : MineMessageParams = {
    expire: unixNow() + 300, // 5 min is enough to make a transaction
    mintTo: wallet, // your wallet
    data1: new BN(0), // temp variable to increment in the miner
    seed // unique seed from get_mining_data
  };

  let msg = Queries.mine(mineParams); // transaction builder
```

Probably, you have a question: where is the _op_ and _data2_ from the table?
* In the table _data1_ must be equal to _data2_. So we can omit filling the _data2_, the transaction builder did a low-level job for us (see `Queries.mine()` sources).
* As `op` is always the same, it is already implemented in transaction builder _Queries_ and in _OperationCodes_. You can find the op code by going to the source code of `mine()` method.

:::tip
You might find it interesting to check out the sources, but it is not necessary.
:::

### Finally: the NFT Miner

What do we need to make a miner? Let's have a look at this line:

```ts
let msg = Queries.mine(mineParams);
```

We have compiled a message `msg` here. The idea of mining is to find a hash `msg.hash()` that will be less than `complexity` from the last received _get_mining_data()_. We can increment `data1` as many times as we need.

So the pure miner will run infinitely while `msg.hash() > complexity`.

Let's see the code adopted for _BigNumbers_ in TypeScript:

```ts title="ton-onboarding-challenge/index.ts"
  let msg = Queries.mine(mineParams);

  while (new BN(msg.hash(), 'be').gt(complexity)) {
    mineParams.expire = unixNow() + 300
    mineParams.data1.iaddn(1)
    msg = Queries.mine(mineParams)
  }

  console.log('Yoo-hoo, you found something!')
```

A few points about _BN_ functions here:
* We create a _big-endian_ BN object from the `msg.hash()` with `'be'` attribute.
* `gt()` means _greater than something_ for comparing _BigNumbers_.
* `iaddn(1)` means just increment the value.

But this miner is still useless for us! How can we progress from here?

#### Let's try to add some beauty ✨

We want to make the miner sexy now! How do we do it?

Just follow me, my friend, follow me:

```ts title="ton-onboarding-challenge/index.ts"
  let msg = Queries.mine(mineParams);
  let progress = 0;

  while (new BN(msg.hash(), 'be').gt(complexity)) {
    progress += 1
    console.clear()
    console.log(`Mining started: please, wait for 30-60 seconds to mine your NFT!`)
    console.log(' ')
    console.log(`⛏ Mined ${progress} hashes! Last: `, new BN(msg.hash(), 'be').toString())

    mineParams.expire = unixNow() + 300
    mineParams.data1.iaddn(1)
    msg = Queries.mine(mineParams)
  }

  console.log(' ')
  console.log('💎 Mission completed: msg_hash less than pow_complexity found!');
  console.log(' ')
  console.log('msg_hash: ', new BN(msg.hash(), 'be').toString())
  console.log('pow_complexity: ', complexity.toString())
  console.log('msg_hash < pow_complexity: ', new BN(msg.hash(), 'be').lt(complexity))
```

After these small improvements you have got an NFT miner and an understanding of what's going on.

Just check it out! Remember:

```bash
npm run start
```

_Cool, isn't it?_ 😏

But, what do we do next? Ok, you found a hash. But what to do with all this stuff???

## 🎨 Prepare a Transaction

We need to _compile a transaction_ and _send it to the blockchain_ with your wallet.

This is exactly what we mean by a __mining an NFT__. We're almost at the finish line now.

### Build a payment link

In TON, it's possible to build [payment urls](https://github.com/tonkeeper/wallet-api#payment-urls) in a format like `ton://transfer/<address>` with different parameters. It's perfect for us, as we want to build a message and send it to the smart contract with our Tonkeeper wallet:

```ts title="ton-onboarding-challenge/index.ts"
import {toNano} from "ton"

// ... previous code

  console.log(' ');
  console.log("💣 WARNING! As soon as you find the hash, you should quickly make a transaction.");
  console.log("If someone else makes a transaction, the seed changes, and you have to find a hash again!");
  console.log(' ');

  // flags work only in user-friendly address form
  const collectionAddr = collection.toFriendly({
    urlSafe: true,
    bounceable: true,
  })
  // we must convert TON to nanoTON
  const amountToSend = toNano('0.05').toString()
 // BOC means Bag Of Cells here
  const preparedBodyCell = msg.toBoc().toString('base64url')

  // final method to build a payment url
  const tonDeepLink = (address: string, amount: string, body: string) => {
    return `ton://transfer/${address}?amount=${amount}&bin=${body}`;
  };

  const link = tonDeepLink(collectionAddr, amountToSend, preparedBodyCell);

  console.log('🚀 Link to receive an NFT:')
  console.log(link);
```

Okay, let's run the script. Do you see the link? Good.

_But what to do with the payment link on your PC?_

It's impossible to use it with a wallet on your smartphone! Let's change that now.

### Convert link for smartphone

As a solution, the most brilliant minds in the world created a QR code generator specifically for use in terminal. With this tool, you can simply scan the payment link from your Tonkeeper wallet to complete a transaction.

```bash
npm install qrcode-terminal
```

Finally, you need to encode your `link` into the QR code and print it in the console:

```ts title="ton-onboarding-challenge/index.ts"
  const qrcode = require('qrcode-terminal');

  qrcode.generate(link, {small: true}, function (qrcode : any) {
    console.log('🚀 Link to mine your NFT (use Tonkeeper in testnet mode):')
    console.log(qrcode);
    console.log('* If QR is still too big, please run script from the terminal. (or make the font smaller)')
  });
```

Do you sense the _experience_ in the air? That's you, on your way to becoming a TVM developer.

But we still don't have any testnet coins to make a transaction.

Let's fix that quickly.
