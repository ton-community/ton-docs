# Blockchain services

## Domain Name Systems

In Ethereum, users use the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), which is a decentralized naming system built on top of the Ethereum blockchain.

The TON blockchain includes an embedded domain name system known as the TON DNS. It is a decentralized service that allows users to register human-readable domain names for their smart contracts, websites, or any other online content. Such a device facilitates interaction with decentralized applications (dApps) and other resources on the TON blockchain. The DNS system in TON functions similarly to traditional Internet DNS systems, but its decentralized nature eliminates the need for a centralized authority to control and manage domain names, thereby reducing the risks of censorship, fraud, and domain name hijacking.

## WWW

TON WWW is a part of the TON blockchain that allows you to create and interact with decentralized websites directly through the blockchain. Unlike traditional websites, websites on TON are accessible via special URLs ending in `.ton` and support unique hyperlinks of the `ton://` format that allow transactions and other operations directly from the URL.

One of the key features of TON WWW is the ability to directly bind crypto wallets to domain names, which allows users to send cryptocurrency to addresses like alice.place.ton without additional details. This greatly simplifies the process of donations and payments, making it more intuitive and convenient.

## Proxy

TON Proxy is a tool based on the TON protocol that offers a high level of security and anonymity. All data transmitted through TON Proxy is encrypted, thus protecting users' confidential information.

One of the key advantages of TON Proxy is its ability to bypass blockades imposed by ISPs or government agencies. This makes it an essential tool for users who need free access to information on the Internet without restrictions.

In addition, TON Proxy helps to speed up Internet connection speeds. It automatically selects the servers with the lowest load, which improves the quality of connection and the speed of Internet access. 

## Decentralised storage

Ethereum is not suitable for storing large amounts of data. Therefore, decentralized storage on Ethereum typically involves using distributed file systems to store and retrieve data in a decentralized and secure manner. One popular approach to decentralized storage on Ethereum is the  InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), which is a peer-to-peer file system that allows users to store and retrieve files from a network of distributed nodes.

TON network has its own decentralised storage service, that is used by the TON Blockchain to store archive copies of blocks and status data (snapshots), but also available for storing usersâ€™ files or other services running on the platform, with torrent-like access technology. The most popular use case is to store NFT metadata directly on TON storage, not using additional distributed file storage services like IPFS.

## Payment services

TON Payments is a solution for lightning-fast transactions with zero network fees on the TON blockchain. While the TON blockchain is sufficient for most tasks, some applications, such as TON Proxy, TON Storage or a certain decentralized application, require micro-transactions with much higher speed and lower costs. Payment channels, also known as the Lightning network, were created to solve this problem. Payment channels allow two parties to make transactions off-chain by creating a special smart contract on the blockchain with their initial balances. They can then perform as many transactions between them as they want without any speed limits or fees. The network's fees are only charged when the channel is opened and closed. The technology also guarantees proper operation by allowing a party to close the channel on its own if the other party cheats or disappears.
