# Quick Start

FunC is a domain-specific statically typed language.

FunC programs are compiled into Fift assembler code, which generates corresponding bytecode for the TON Virtual Machine.

Further this bytecode (actually a tree of cells, like any other data in TON Blockchain) can be used for creating a smart contract in the blockchain or can be run on a local instance of TVM.

## Local development

Developing smart contracts on FunC could be more comfortable using resources from Community:
- IDE plugins
