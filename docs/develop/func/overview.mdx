# Overview

A high-level language FunC is used to program smart contracts on TON.

FunC is a domain-specific, C-like, statically typed language.
Here is a simple example method for sending money written in FunC:

```func
() send_money(slice address, int amount) impure inline {
    var msg = begin_cell()
        .store_uint(0x10, 6) ;; nobounce
        .store_slice(address)
        .store_coins(amount)
        .end_cell();

    send_raw_message(msg, 64);
}
```

FunC programs are compiled into Fift assembler code, which generates corresponding bytecode for the [TON Virtual Machine](/learn/tvm-instructions/tvm-overview).

Further this bytecode (actually a [tree of cells](/learn/overviews/cells), like any other data in TON Blockchain) can be used for creating smart contracts in the blockchain or can be run on a local instance of TVM.

## Compiler

### Compile with JS

Most convenient and quick way to begin develop and compile smart contracts is using Blueprint framework. Read more in [Blueprint](/develop/smart-contracts/sdk/javascript) section.

```bash
npm create ton@latest
```

### Compile with original binaries 

If you want to use native TON compiler FunC locally you need binaries setup on your machine. FunC compiler binaries for Windows, MacOS (Intel/M1), and Ubuntu can be downloaded from:
* [Environment Setup Page](/develop/smart-contracts/environment/installation)

:::info
At the same time you can always make binaries from sources like:  
[FunC compiler source code](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/tree/master/crypto/func) (read [how to compile](/develop/howto/compile#func) a FunC compiler from sources).

## TON Course: FunC

The [TON Blockchain Course](https://stepik.org/course/176754/) is a comprehensive guide to TON Blockchain development.

Module 4 completely covers FunC language and smart contracts development.

## Smart contract examples

Standard basic smart contracts like wallets, electors (manages validation on TON), multi-signature wallets, etc. can be a reference when studying.
