# TON Documentation

Welcome to the official TON Blockchain development documentation!

This resource aims to provide you with all the necessary information you'll need to build, test, and deploy applications on the TON Blockchain.

This is a collaborative open-source initiative, and contributions are always welcome. All documentation can be edited via GitHub, just [follow these instructions](/contribute).

- _TON Hello World_ series provides detailed step-by-step guides to wallets, smart contracts, mini apps, and testing & debugging smart contracts on TON.
- _Get Started with TON_ is a step-by-step guide to interacting with TON Blockchain. (video tutorial included)

### Blockchain Basics with TON

* [Blockchain Basics with TON](https://stepik.org/course/201294/promo) ([RU version](https://stepik.org/course/202221/), [CHN version](https://stepik.org/course/200976/)) - 
This course introduces blockchain basics, with a special focus on practical skills in the TON ecosystem. You will understand how blockchain functions and its diverse applications.

### TON Course

We're proud to present the __TON Blockchain Course__, which is a comprehensive guide to the TON Blockchain. The course is designed for developers who want to learn how to create smart contracts and decentralized applications on the TON Blockchain in engaging and interactive ways.

It consists of __9 modules__ and covers the basics of the TON Blockchain, the FunC programming language, and the TON Virtual Machine (TVM).

## Smart Contracts Development

Smart contracts are the building blocks of decentralized applications (DApps) on TON Blockchain. If you're looking to develop your own dApps, it's essential to understand how smart contracts work.

* [How to work with wallet smart contracts](/develop/smart-contracts/tutorials/wallet) - Detailed and careful explanations of smart contract basics with the use of JS and GO.
* [Learn Smart Contracts by examples](/develop/smart-contracts/examples) (FunC, Fift)
* [Speed Run TON](/develop/smart-contracts/examples) - 6 interactive challenges and step-by-step tutorials to learn smart contracts development.

## DApp Development

Decentralized applications (DApps) are applications that run on a peer-to-peer network of computers rather than a single computer (TON Blockchain). They are similar to traditional web applications, but they are built on top of a blockchain network. This means that DApps are decentralized, meaning that no single entity controls them.
