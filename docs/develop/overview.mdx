# TON Documentation

Welcome to the official TON Blockchain development documentation!

This resource aims to provide you with all the necessary information you'll need to build, test, and deploy applications on the TON Blockchain.

This is a collaborative open-source initiative, and contributions are always welcome. All documentation can be edited via GitHub, just [follow these instructions](/contribute).

- _Get Started with TON_ is a step-by-step guide to interacting with TON Blockchain. (video tutorial included)
- _TON Hello World_ series provides detailed step-by-step guides to wallets, smart contracts, mini apps, and testing & debugging smart contracts on TON.

## Smart Contracts Development

Smart contracts are the building blocks of decentralized applications (DApps) on TON Blockchain. If you're looking to develop your own dApps, it's essential to understand how smart contracts work.

The following resources provide valuable information for TON smart contract development:

* [TON Hello World: Step-by-step guide for writing your first smart contract](https://ton-community.github.io/tutorials/02-contract/) - An accessible and concise explanation of the fundamentals with JS.
* [How to work with wallet smart contracts](/develop/smart-contracts/tutorials/wallet) - Detailed and careful explanations of smart contract basics with the use of JS and GO.
* [Learn Smart Contracts by examples](/develop/smart-contracts/examples) (FunC, Fift)


## DApp Development

Decentralized applications (DApps) are applications that run on a peer-to-peer network of computers rather than a single computer (TON Blockchain). They are similar to traditional web applications, but they are built on top of a blockchain network. This means that DApps are decentralized, meaning that no single entity controls them.

### DeFi Development

* [TON Connect](/develop/dapps/ton-connect/overview) — integration and authentication for DApps.
* [Off-chain Payments Processing](/develop/dapps/asset-processing) — examples and concepts for processing payments.
* [TON Jetton processing](/develop/dapps/asset-processing/jettons) — examples and concepts for processing Jettons.
* [Fungible (FT) / Non-fungible (NFT) tokens](/develop/dapps/defi/tokens) — smart contracts, examples, tools

Take your first steps in DApps development with a comprehensive DApps building guide:
