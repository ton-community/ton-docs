## Smart Contracts Development

Smart contracts are the building blocks of decentralized applications (DApps) on TON Blockchain. If you're looking to develop your own dApps, it's essential to understand how smart contracts work.

The following resources provide valuable information for TON smart contract development:

* [TON Hello World: Step-by-step guide for writing your first smart contract](https://ton-community.github.io/tutorials/02-contract/) - An accessible and concise explanation of the fundamentals with JS.
* [How to work with wallet smart contracts](/develop/smart-contracts/tutorials/wallet) - Detailed and careful explanations of smart contract basics with the use of JS and GO.
* [Learn Smart Contracts by examples](/develop/smart-contracts/examples) (FunC, Fift)
* [Speed Run TON](/develop/smart-contracts/examples) - 6 interactive challenges and step-by-step tutorials to learn smart contracts development.

## DApp Development

Decentralized applications (DApps) are applications that run on a peer-to-peer network of computers rather than a single computer (TON Blockchain). They are similar to traditional web applications, but they are built on top of a blockchain network. This means that DApps are decentralized, meaning that no single entity controls them.
