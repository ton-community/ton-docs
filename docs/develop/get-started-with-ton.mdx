### Mining on TON Blockchain

Today, we are going to teach our prospective builders how to mine on TON Blockchain. This experience will allow all of you to understand the significance of mining and why Bitcoin mining helped revolutionize the industry.

Though the PoW Giver smart contract framework that defined the initial mining process that helped lay the foundation for TON was completed at launch, the last TON was mined in June of 2022 to culminate TON’s Proof of Work (PoW) token distribution mechanism. That said, with our recent transition to Proof of Stake (PoS), the era of staking on TON has just begun.

* [Dive deeper into our economic model and mining on TON](https://ton.org/mining)


Now, let’s focus on the first steps to becoming a **TVM Developer** and learn how to mine an NFT on TON! Provided below is an example of what we're aiming to create.
````mdx-code-block
<div style={{ width: '100%', textAlign: 'center', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <video style={{ width: '100%', borderRadius: '10pt', margin: '15pt auto', maxWidth: '90%' }} muted={true} autoPlay={true}
         loop={true}>
    <source src="/files/onboarding.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
````
Your browser does not support the video tag.
````mdx-code-block
  </video>
</div>
````
It’s possible to create a miner in about half an hour if we keep focused on the task at hand.

## 🦄 Getting started

To get started, all developers will make use of the following components:

* __Wallet__: You need a non-custodial wallet to store an NFT in testnet mode.
* __Repository__:  We’ll use a ready-made template designed specifically for you.
* __Developer Environment__:  Developers will need to determine whether they want to mine using a local or cloud environment.

### Download and Create a Wallet

To start off, you’ll need a non-custodial wallet that will allow you to receive and store your TON; for this purpose in this guide we are using Tonkeeper. You’ll need to enable Testnet mode within the wallet to be able to receive Testnet Toncoins. These tokens will be used later on to send a final minting transaction to the smart contract.

:::info
With a non-custodial wallet, the user owns the wallet and holds its private key by themselves.
:::

To download and create a TON wallet follow these simple steps:

1. Install the Tonkeeper app on your smartphone. It can be downloaded [here](https://Tonkeeper.com/).
2. Next, you’ll need to [enable test mode](/participate/wallets/apps#Tonkeeper-test-environment) within Tonkeeper.

Easy! Let's go to the development now.

### Project setup

To make your life easier and skip routine low-level stuff, we will use a boilerplate.

:::tip
Note, you'll need to [sign in](https://github.com/login) to GitHub for further work.
:::

Please, use the [ton-onboarding-challenge](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-onboarding-challenge) template to create your project by clicking on the “Use this template” button and selecting the “Create a new repository” tab as shown below:

````mdx-code-block
<br></br>
<ThemedImage
    alt=""
    sources={{
        light: '/img/tutorials/onboarding/1.png?raw=true',
        dark: '/img/tutorials/onboarding/1-dark.png?raw=true',
    }}
/>
<br></br>
````
After completing this step, you’ll have access to a highly performant repository that can be used as your miner's core. Congratulations! ✨

### Development Environments

The next step is to choose which developer environment is best suited to your needs, experience level, and overall skill-set. As you can see, it is possible to carry out this process by using either a cloud-based or local environment. Developing on the cloud is often considered simpler and easier to get started. Below, we’ll outline the steps required for both approaches.

:::tip
Make sure you have opened the repository in your GitHub profile that was generated from the template in the previous step.
:::

````mdx-code-block
<br></br>
<ThemedImage
    alt=""
    sources={{
        light: '/img/tutorials/onboarding/3.png?raw=true',
        dark: '/img/tutorials/onboarding/3-dark.png?raw=true',
    }}
/>
<br></br>
````
#### Local and Cloud Development Environments

* For users who are not familiar with JavaScript, it can be challenging to use a JavaScript IDE, especially if your computer and tooling systems are not configured for this purpose.

* However, if you're familiar with NodeJS and Git and know how to work with `npm`, it may be more comfortable for you to use a **local environment**.

#### Cloud Codespaces

If you choose the cloud development environment it's easy to get started by first selecting the _Code_ tab and then by clicking on the _Create codespace on master_ button within the GitHub repository like shown below:

````mdx-code-block
<br></br>
<ThemedImage
    alt=""
    sources={{
        light: '/img/tutorials/onboarding/2.png?raw=true',
        dark: '/img/tutorials/onboarding/2-dark.png?raw=true',
    }}
/>
<br></br>
````
After completing this step, GitHub will create a special cloud workspace that allows you to access the VSCode Online IDE (Visual Code Online Integrated Development Environment).

Once access is granted (the codespace typically starts in about 30 seconds), you'll have everything required to begin without the need to install Git, Node.js, or other developer tools.

#### Local Development Environments

To set up a local development environment, you'll require access to these three essential tools:

- **Git**: Git is an essential tool that every developer needs to work with repositories. It can be downloaded [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **NodeJS**: Node.js is the JavaScript and TypeScript runtime environment typically used for application development on TON. It can be downloaded [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- **JavaScript IDE**. JavaScript IDE’s are typically used for development within local development environments. An example of this case is Visual Studio Code ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)).

To get started, you’ll need to clone your GitHub repository boilerplate and open the correct repository in your Integrated Development Environment (IDE).


#### Running Scripts

In this guide, you'll need to run TypeScript scripts. All commands, such as running scripts or installing modules, are executed through the command line, which is located in the IDE's Terminal workspace. This workspace is typically found at the bottom of the IDE.

For example, in the Cloud Codespaces, you should open the Terminal workspace (if it is not already open):

````mdx-code-block
<br></br>
<ThemedImage
    alt=""
    sources={{
        light: '/img/tutorials/onboarding/6.png?raw=true',
        dark: '/img/tutorials/onboarding/6-dark.png?raw=true',
    }}
/>
<br></br><br></br>
````
Enter commands in this window and execute them with _Enter_:

````mdx-code-block
<br></br>
<ThemedImage
    alt=""
    sources={{
        light: '/img/tutorials/onboarding/4.png?raw=true',
        dark: '/img/tutorials/onboarding/4-dark.png?raw=true',
    }}
/>
<br></br><br></br>
````
The Terminal is also available as a separate application. Please choose the appropriate version based on your IDE and OS.

Great! After these steps you're ready to get deeper into TON Blockchain secrets. 👀

## 🎯 Connect to TON

Okay, what do you need to connect to TON Blockchain?

* __Smart contract address__ as a point of destination. Our goal is to mine an NFT from the _proof-of-work smart contract_, so we need an address to get current mining complexity.
* __API provider__ to make requests to TON Blockchain. TON has multiple [API types](/develop/dapps/apis/) for different purposes. We will use the testnet version of [toncenter.com](https://toncenter.com/) API.
* __JavaScript SDK__: A JavaScript SDK (recall that an SDK is a Software Development Kit) is needed to parse the smart contract address being used and prepare it to create an API request. To better understand TON addresses and why they need to be parsed to carry out this process, please see this [resource](/learn/overviews/addresses) to understand why should we parse it. To carry out this procedure, we'll use [ton.js](https://github.com/ton-core/ton).

In the next section we’ll describe how users send their initial requests to TON Blockchain using the TONCenter API and ton.js to receive data from the PoW smart contract.

### Smart Contract Addresses

For the miner to work correctly, we need to add two different smart contract address types. These include:

1. __Wallet address__: A wallet address is required,  because it is necessary for the miner to receive their mining reward (in this case, we must use the [Tonkeeper Testnet mode](/participate/wallets/apps#Tonkeeper-test-environment)).
2. __Collection address__: A collection address is required to act as a smart contract to correctly mine an NFT (to carry out this process copy the NFT collection address, under the TON unboarding challenge collection name from the [Getgems website](https://testnet.getgems.io/collection/EQDk8N7xM5D669LC2YACrseBJtDyFqwtSPCNhRWXU7kjEptX)).

Next, we’ll open the `index.ts` file in your miner and create a main function composed of initial constants as follows:


```ts title="ton-onboarding-challenge/index.ts"
import {Address} from "ton"

async function main () {

  const wallet = Address.parse('YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS');
  const collection = Address.parse('COLLECTION_ADDRESS');

}

main()
```

#### Using the async main() Function

Later in the process of creating a TON NFT Miner, several requests will be executed to the public API to relay responses to the correct string of code in exchange for the desired instructions. By leveraging the Async/await function, code simplicity is improved dramatically.

#### Address Parsing

On TON, smart contract addresses come in different forms that employ the use of numerous flag types. In this context specifically, we’ll make use of the _user-friendly address form_. That said, if you are curious to learn more about the different smart contract address types, feel free to check out this additional [resource](https://ton.org/docs/learn/overviews/addresses) in our documentation.

For the miner to work correctly, we need to add two different smart contract address types. These include:

The `Address.parse()` command found in the `ton.js` SDK allows the developer to create an address object to convert addresses from one form to another in a simplified manner.

### Connect to an API Provider

In this step, we'll connect with TON via TONCenter (which is hosted on toncenter.com) API provider using specific commands in the script.

The simplest way to learn how it works is by using @orbs-network/ton-access.

:::tip
Remember, if you are adding new modules with `import`, that you may need to install them by executing the command `npm i @orbs-network/ton-access` in the [terminal](/develop/get-started-with-ton#running-scripts).
:::

````mdx-code-block
<br></br>
<ThemedImage
    alt=""
    sources={{
        light: '/img/tutorials/onboarding/5.png?raw=true',
        dark: '/img/tutorials/onboarding/5-dark.png?raw=true',
    }}
/>
<br></br>
````

We are adding `client` and `endpoint` in the `index.ts` script using _TonClient_ and _getHttpEndpoint_ from `@orbs-network/ton-access`:

```ts title="ton-onboarding-challenge/index.ts"
import {Address, TonClient} from "ton"
import {getHttpEndpoint} from "@orbs-network/ton-access";

  // ... previous code

  // get the decentralized RPC endpoint in Testnet
  const endpoint = await getHttpEndpoint({
    network: "testnet",
  });

  // initialize ton library
  const client = new TonClient({ endpoint });

```

:::info what to do in production?
It's better to use an RPC node provider, or to run your own ton-http-api instance for that. Read more at the [TonCenter API page](/develop/dapps/apis/toncenter).
:::

### Receiving Mining Data From TON Blockchain

Finally, the next step in the process is to retrieve specific mining data from TON Blockchain.

By consulting the [README file](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-onboarding-challenge#mining-process-advanced) needed to complete the ton-onboarding-challenge, the latest TON mining data is obtained by running the `get_mining_data` method. Once initiated, the result will be as follows:

As a result we should receive an array with these fields:

```bash
(
	int pow_complexity,
	int last_success,
	int seed,
	int target_delta,
	int min_cpl,
	int max_cpl
)
```

#### Running Smart Contract Get Methods on TON

Using `ton.js` it is possible to run the callGetMethod (SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS, METHOD) function.
Running this code will result in the following console output:


```ts title="ton-onboarding-challenge/index.ts"
  // ... previous code

  const miningData = await client.callGetMethod(collection, 'get_mining_data')

  console.log(miningData)
```



Furthermore, to run the script, it is necessary to enter the following command [in the terminal](/develop/get-started-with-ton#running-scripts):

```bash
npm run start
```
:::tip
To avoid unexpected issues, make sure you have finalized all previous steps, including inputting contract addresses.
:::

Good! As long as the above processes were executed correctly, successful connection to the API will be achieved and the necessary data will be displayed in the console. The correct console output should be initiated as follows:

```bash
{
  gas_used: 2374,
  stack: [
    [
      'num',
      '0x2880000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'
    ],
    [ 'num', '0x63984815' ],
    [ 'num', '0x357401cf9b4f2386950faefd6b616264' ],
    [ 'num', '0x1e' ],
    [ 'num', '0xab' ],
    [ 'num', '0xfc' ]
  ]
}
```

Above it displays the gas amount used to execute the process, as well as the sum of numerical (_num_) values in hex format. At this time, this data is not too critical because it is necessary to convert the hex output data into something that can be used more easily.

We need to convert the hex output to something _useful_.

:::info GAS PARAMETERS ON TON:
__Warning__: Though this information is highly complex and __not necessary for this tutorial__, if you’re interested in understanding the complex technical aspects of TON consider using these resources:
1. To obtain a better understanding of how TON Virtual Machine (TVM) operates and _how does TON process transactions_, check out [TVM overview section](/learn/tvm-instructions/tvm-overview).
2. Secondly, if you are interested in learning more about how transaction and gas fees work on TON, consider diving into [this section](/develop/smart-contracts/fees) of our documentation.
3. Finally, to get a better understanding of the exact gas values needed to carry out TVM instructions see [this section](/learn/tvm-instructions/instructions#gas-prices) of our documentation.
:::

Now, let's return to the tutorial!

#### Numerical Mining Data in a User-Friendly Format

In the section above where we discuss gas amounts and numerical (_num_) values in hex format needed to receive mining data, we note that the hex numbers present within the strings of code must be converted into a more easily understandable and usable format.

As it is clear when examining the given output, hex numbers can be quite substantial in size. It's not possible to make a variable and make use of them, because of specific [JavaScript limitations](https://stackoverflow.com/a/307200) that are outlined here.

We need a way to translate this, that’s where the `bn.js` (the big number implementation in JavaScript) library comes in. Bn.js is a library developers use to work with large numbers that are larger than the maximum JavaScript integer values. Let’s use this example to get a better idea of the _Mining Data_ required for this process:


```ts title="ton-onboarding-challenge/index.ts"
import {BN} from 'bn.js'

  // ... previous code

  const parseStackNum = (sn: any) => new BN(sn[1].substring(2), 'hex');

  const complexity = parseStackNum(miningData.stack[0]);
  const last_success = parseStackNum(miningData.stack[1]);
  const seed = parseStackNum(miningData.stack[2]);
  const target_delta = parseStackNum(miningData.stack[3]);
  const min_cpl = parseStackNum(miningData.stack[4]);
  const max_cpl = parseStackNum(miningData.stack[5]);

  console.log('complexity', complexity);
  console.log('last_success', last_success.toString());
  console.log('seed', seed);
  console.log('target_delta', target_delta.toString());
  console.log('min_cpl', min_cpl.toString());
  console.log('max_cpl', max_cpl.toString());
```

As shown above, the different components of _miningData_ use a stack-based array with hex numbers for different parameters (which will be introduced in the section below). To achieve the desired value outcome, we added the parseStackNum function to create a BN (Big Number) object from a hex number.

After this process is complete, it is necessary to print values within the console. In this case, some values are printed as BN objects, which will make the process more user-friendly. Try to run the script again by running the command:

```bash
npm run start
```

Here is an example output:

```bash
complexity <BN: 2880000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000>
last_success 1670924309
seed <BN: 357401cf9b4f2386950faefd6b616264>
target_delta 30
min_cpl 171
max_cpl 252
```

Let's cover the Mining Data command that is used to translate different data parameters when programming mining data into TON Blockchain. These include:

* `complexity` is the most important number for miners. It's a Proof-of-Work complexity for the values. You're successful _if the final hash is less than complexity_.
* `last_success` is a [unix timestamp](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/) date and time representation that keeps track of the last mining transaction on TON. Each time the last_success metric changes, it's necessary to run the miner again because the seed also changes during this process.
* `seed` denotes a unique value generated by a smart contract to calculate the desired hash. To better understand this process and learn more about how the seed changes and why, have a look at the project files folder by using the ctx_seed keyword(Ctrl+F with keyword "ctx_seed").
* `target_delta`, `min_cpl` and `max_cpl` won't be used in our tutorial. But you can always read more about how they are used in smart contracts to calculate proof-of-work complexity in the source files of the collection in your project.

Now that we understand the different parameters discussed above, we have the values(`complexity`, `last_success`, `seed`) which we will use in our NFT Miner in the next chapter.

## 🛠 Prepare a NFT Miner

Hey, you're doing a great job!

After connecting to TON and retrieving the necessary mining data from the blockchain to create an NFT Miner, let’s focus on the next steps in this process to achieve our goal.

In this chapter you will _prepare a mining message_ and _calculate a hash_ of the message. After that, you will _find a hash that's less(`<`) than the complexity_ we got from the smart contract.

That is what a miner is! Simple, isn't it?

### Preparing Mining Messages

First, we must prepare a mining message by ensuring the correct parameters to ensure the validity and data integrity of this process.

Thankfully, the [README file](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-onboarding-challenge#mining-process-advanced) allows us to retrieve the correct guidelines needed to achieve this goal. As you can see, the above README file comprises a table with certain fields and Cell types (titled “Layout of Proof of Work Cell’) to help achieve our desired result.

:::info WHAT ARE CELLS?
Cells are data storage structures on TON that fulfill numerous purposes, including increasing network scalable and smart contract transaction speeds. We won’t get into specifics here, but if you’re interested in understanding the complexity of cells and how they work, consider diving into [this](/learn/overviews/cells) section of our documentation.
:::

Fortunately, all the data structures used in this tutorial are already written in TypeScript. Use the `MineMessageParams` object from _NftGiver.data.ts_ to build a transaction with _Queries_:

```ts title="ton-onboarding-challenge/index.ts"
  import {unixNow} from "./src/lib/utils";
  import {MineMessageParams, Queries} from "./src/giver/NftGiver.data";

  // ... previous code

  const mineParams : MineMessageParams = {
    expire: unixNow() + 300, // 5 min is enough to make a transaction
    mintTo: wallet, // your wallet
    data1: new BN(0), // temp variable to increment in the miner
    seed // unique seed from get_mining_data
  };

  let msg = Queries.mine(mineParams); // transaction builder
```

Probably, you have a question: where are the _op_ and _data2_ from the [table](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-onboarding-challenge#mining-process-advanced)?
* In the table, the numerical value of data1 must be equal to that of data2. In order to omit filling the data2 value, the transaction builder performs a low-level process (see Queries.mine() sources).
* Because the `op` classification is always constant, it is already implemented in transaction builder _Queries_ and in _OperationCodes_. You can find the op code by going to the source code of `mine()` method.

:::tip
Though it may be interesting to check out the source code (`./src/giver/NftGiver.data`), it is not necessary.
:::

### Creating TON NFT Miners

Now that we have completed the process to prepare messages for our TON miner, let’s jump into the initial process to actually create a miner. First, let’s consider this line of code:

```ts
let msg = Queries.mine(mineParams);
```

Above we compiled a `msg` value. The idea of mining is to find a hash `msg.hash()` that will be less than `complexity` from the last received _get_mining_data()_. We can increment `data1` as many times as we need.

The pure miner will continue to run indefinitely, as long as `msg.hash()` is bigger than `complexity` (message hash is larger than PoW mining complexity).

Here is an example of the code running as it relates to BigNumbers in TypeScript:

```ts title="ton-onboarding-challenge/index.ts"
  let msg = Queries.mine(mineParams);

  while (new BN(msg.hash(), 'be').gt(complexity)) {
    mineParams.expire = unixNow() + 300
    mineParams.data1.iaddn(1)
    msg = Queries.mine(mineParams)
  }

  console.log('Yoo-hoo, you found something!')
```

A few important considerations regarding Big Number (_BN_) functions:
* We create a _big-endian_ BN object from the `msg.hash()` with `'be'` attribute.
* `gt()`: denotes _greater than a variable_ for comparing _BigNumbers_.
* `iaddn(1)`: denotes an incremented value.

Though the miner will work properly after the completion of the above steps, it will have a visually unappealing appearance (try `npm run start`). Therefore, we must address this issue. Let’s jump in.

#### Improving TON Miner Appearance ✨

We want to make the miner look sexy now! How do we do it?

Just follow me, my friend, follow me.

To achieve our goal, we’ll add these commands:

```ts title="ton-onboarding-challenge/index.ts"
  let msg = Queries.mine(mineParams);
  let progress = 0;

  while (new BN(msg.hash(), 'be').gt(complexity)) {
    progress += 1
    console.clear()
    console.log(`Mining started: please, wait for 30-60 seconds to mine your NFT!`)
    console.log(' ')
    console.log(`⛏ Mined ${progress} hashes! Last: `, new BN(msg.hash(), 'be').toString())

    mineParams.expire = unixNow() + 300
    mineParams.data1.iaddn(1)
    msg = Queries.mine(mineParams)
  }

  console.log(' ')
  console.log('💎 Mission completed: msg_hash less than pow_complexity found!');
  console.log(' ')
  console.log('msg_hash: ', new BN(msg.hash(), 'be').toString())
  console.log('pow_complexity: ', complexity.toString())
  console.log('msg_hash < pow_complexity: ', new BN(msg.hash(), 'be').lt(complexity))
```

Just check it out! Let’s execute the command:

```bash
npm run start
```

````mdx-code-block
<br></br>
<ThemedImage
    alt=""
    sources={{
        light: '/img/tutorials/onboarding/7.png?raw=true',
        dark: '/img/tutorials/onboarding/7-dark.png?raw=true',
    }}
/>
<br></br>
````
_Cool, isn't it?_ 😏

After these commands are executed correctly, we’ll have a visually appealing NFT miner. In the next section, we’ll focus on connecting a wallet to the miner to create a payment channel that can accept and receive transactions from TON Blockchain.


## 🎨 Prepare a Transaction

Next, we’ll outline the steps to compile a message and send it to the blockchain with your [Tonkeeper wallet](https://Tonkeeper.com/).
The upcoming steps will guide you in completing the process of __mining an NFT__ on TON.


### Creating a Payment Link

In order to ensure that the NFT mining process is carried out correctly, and that the user can store their NFT properly, we must create a payment link that is able to simultaneously interact with TON Blockchain and the Tonkeeper wallet.

To achieve this goal, we’ll initiate the creation of a payment URL (a payment link) using the `ton://transfer/<address>` format that can be customized using different parameters. This will work perfectly because we want to create a message, and send it to the smart contract using our Tonkeeper wallet:

```ts title="ton-onboarding-challenge/index.ts"
import {toNano} from "ton"

// ... previous code

  console.log(' ');
  console.log("💣 WARNING! As soon as you find the hash, you should quickly send the transaction.");
  console.log("If someone else sends a transaction before you, the seed changes, and you'll have to find the hash again!");
  console.log(' ');

  // flags work only in user-friendly address form
  const collectionAddr = collection.toFriendly({
    urlSafe: true,
    bounceable: true,
  })
  // we must convert TON to nanoTON
  const amountToSend = toNano('0.05').toString()
 // BOC means Bag Of Cells here
  const preparedBodyCell = msg.toBoc().toString('base64url')

  // final method to build a payment URL
  const tonDeepLink = (address: string, amount: string, body: string) => {
    return `ton://transfer/${address}?amount=${amount}&bin=${body}`;
  };

  const link = tonDeepLink(collectionAddr, amountToSend, preparedBodyCell);

  console.log('🚀 Link to receive an NFT:')
  console.log(link);
```

Let’s run the above script to launch the newly created payment link. Now it’s time to make the payment link running on your PC smartphone compatible. Let’s get started.

### Creating A Smartphone Compatible Payment Link

As a solution, the most brilliant minds in the world created a QR code generator specifically for use in terminal. With this tool, you can simply scan the payment link from your Tonkeeper wallet to send a transaction.

```bash
npm install qrcode-terminal
```

Finally, we’ll need to encode the payment link(`link`) into the QR code and print it in the console. This is completed by following the steps below:


```ts title="ton-onboarding-challenge/index.ts"
  const qrcode = require('qrcode-terminal');

  qrcode.generate(link, {small: true}, function (qrcode : any) {
    console.log('🚀 Link to mine your NFT (use Tonkeeper in testnet mode):')
    console.log(qrcode);
    console.log('* If QR is still too big, please run script from the terminal. (or make the font smaller)')
  });
```

Do you sense the _experience_ in the air? That's you, on your way to becoming a TVM developer.

Now that we have successfully encoded the QR code generator and payment link, we'll need to acquire some Testnet Toncoins to send our first transaction. This is accomplished by making use of a TON [token faucet](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/faucet) (a Telegram Bot that shares Testnet Toncoins) on TON Blockchain, so we are in possession of some tokens that can be sent to the Tonkeeper wallet we created.


## ⛏  Mine an NFT With a Wallet

There are two main ways to mine an NFT on TON:

* [Simple: NFT Testnet Mining](/develop/get-started-with-ton#simple-mine-in-testnet)
* [Genuine: NFT Mainnet Mining](/develop/get-started-with-ton#genuine-mine-in-mainnet)

### Simple: NFT Testnet Mining

Below are the steps needed to initiate your first Testnet transaction to mine your NFT:

1. Activate [Testnet mode within your Tonkeeper wallet](/participate/wallets/apps#Tonkeeper-test-environment)
2. Input our testnet wallet address from Tonkeeper into `wallet` variable in the `index.ts`
3. Input address of the [NFT collection from Testnet](https://testnet.getgems.io/collection/EQDk8N7xM5D669LC2YACrseBJtDyFqwtSPCNhRWXU7kjEptX) into `collection` variable in the `index.ts`

#### Top Up Wallet Balance via the Token Faucet

To proceed to the next step, we need to acquire some TON testnet tokens. This can be achieved by making use of the testnet [faucet found here](https://t.me/testgiver_ton_bot).

#### Mine A Testnet NFT Rocket

In order to successfully mine an NFT rocket on Testnet, it is necessary to follow these steps:

1. _Open_ Open the Tonkeeper wallet on your phone (it should hold some newly received TON Testnet tokens).
2. _Select_ scan mode in the wallet to scan the QR code.
3. _Run_ your miner to acquire the correct hash (this process takes between 30 and 60 seconds).
4. _Scan_ the generated QR code from the miner.

:::tip final tip
Because there may be other developers carrying out the same process in an attempt to mine their own NFT, you may have to try the process a couple times to be successful (as another user could mine the next NFT available right before you).
:::

Soon after initiating this process, you will have successfully mined your very first NFT on TON (it should appear in your Tonkeeper wallet).

Welcome aboard, __a true TVM Developer__! You did it. 🛳

### Genuine: NFT Mainnet Mining


Hey! For those who wish to mine an NFT on TON Mainnet, these instructions should be followed:

1. You have activated _mainnet_ mode in your Tonkeeper (it should hold at least 0.1 TON).
2. Input our _mainnet_ wallet address from Tonkeeper into `wallet` variable in the `index.ts`
3. Input address of the [NFT collection from the Mainnet](https://getgems.io/collection/EQDk8N7xM5D669LC2YACrseBJtDyFqwtSPCNhRWXU7kjEptX) into `collection` variable in the `index.ts`
4. Replace __endpoint__ to the _Mainnet_, for orbs-access it enables with excluding testnet argument in _getHttpEndpoint_:

```ts title="ton-onboarding-challenge/index.ts"
// get the decentralized RPC endpoint in Mainnet
const endpoint = await getHttpEndpoint();
```


#### Mine A Mainnet NFT Rocket

Like we outlined in the testnet NFT rocket mining process, in order to successfully mine an NFT rocket on mainnet, it is necessary to follow these steps:

1. _Open_ the Tonkeeper wallet on your phone (remember, it should hold some TON tokens).
2. _Select_ scan mode in the wallet to scan the QR code.
3. _Run_ your miner to acquire the correct hash (this process takes between 30 and 60 seconds).
4. _Scan_ the generated QR code from the miner.

:::tip final tip
Because there may be other developers carrying out the same process in an attempt to mine their own NFT, you may have to try the process a couple times to be successful (as another user could mine the next NFT available right before you).

After some time, you will have __mined your NFT__ and become a TVM Developer in TON Blockchain. The ritual is complete. Look at your NFT in Tonkeeper.
