# Writing Tests with Blueprint

## Overview

Test toolkit (usually, sandbox) already included to the TypeScript SDK named [Blueprint](/develop/smart-contracts/sdk/javascript). You can create demo project and launch default test with two steps:

1. Create a new Blueprint project:
```bash
npm create ton@latest MyProject
```

2. Run a test:
```bash
cd MyProject
npx blueprint test
```

As a result you'll see corresponding output in the terminal window:

```bash
% npx blueprint test

> MyProject@0.0.1 test
> jest

 PASS  tests/Main.spec.ts

## Basic Usage
Testing of smart contracts allows for the coverage of security, optimization of gas spending, and examination of edge cases.
Writing tests in Blueprint (that based on [Sandbox](https://github.com/ton-org/sandbox)) works through defining arbitary actions with the contract and comparing their results with the expected result, for example:

```typescript
it('should execute with success', async () => {                              // description of the test case
    const res = await main.sendMessage(sender.getSender(), toNano('0.05'));  // performing an action with contract main and saving result in res

    expect(res.transactions).toHaveTransaction({                             // configure the expected result with expect() function
        from: main.address,                                                  // set expected sender for transaction we want to test matcher properties from
        success: true                                                        // set the desirable result using matcher property success
    });

    printTransactionFees(res.transactions);                                  // print table with details on spent fees
});
```


### Writing Tests for Complex Assertion

The basic workflow of creating a test is:
1. Create a specific wrapped `Contract` entity using `blockchain.openContract()`.
2. Describe the actions your `Contract` should perform and save the execution result in `res` variable.
3. Verify the properties using the `expect()` function and the matcher `toHaveTransaction()`.

The `toHaveTransaction` matcher expects an object with any combination of fields from the `FlatTransaction` type defined with the following properties

| Name                 | Type          | Description                                                                                                                                                         |
|----------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| from                 | Address?      | Contract address of the message sender                                                                                                                              |
| on                   | Address       | Contract address of the message destination  (Alternative name of the property `to`).                                                                               |
| value                | bigint?       | Amount of Toncoins in the message in nanotons                                                                                                                       |
| body                 | Cell          | Message body defined as a Cell                                                                                                                                              |
| op                   | number?       | Op code is the operation identifier number (crc32 from TL-B usually). Expected in the first 32 bits of a message body.                                              |
|success| boolean?       | Custom Sandbox flag that defines the resulting status of a certain transaction. True - if both the compute and the action phase succeeded. Otherwise - False.       |

You can omit those that you're not interested in, and you can also pass in functions accepting those types returning booleans (`true` meaning good) to check for example number ranges, message opcodes, etc. Note however that if a field is optional (like `from?: Address`), then the function needs to accept the optional type, too.
