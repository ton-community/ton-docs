# Writing Tests Examples

This page demonstrates how to write test for FunC contracts created in with [Blueprint SDK](https://github.com/ton-org/blueprint) ([Sandbox](https://github.com/ton-org/sandbox)).
Test suites built for demo contract [fireworks](https://github.com/ton-community/fireworks-func). The fireworks is a smart contract which initially run via `set_first` message.

Once a new FunC project is created via `npm create ton@latest`, a test file `tests/contract.spec.ts` will be autogenerated in the project directory for testing the contract:

```typescript
import ...

describe('Fireworks', () => {
...


        expect(deployResult.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
...
        });

});

it('should deploy', async () => {
    // the check is done inside beforeEach
    // blockchain and fireworks are ready to use
});
```


Running tests using the following command:

```bash
npx blueprint test
```

Additional options and vmLogs may be specified with `blockchain.verbosity`:

```typescript
blockchain.verbosity = {
    ...blockchain.verbosity,
    blockchainLogs: true,
    vmLogs: 'vm_logs_full',
    debugLogs: true,
    print: false,
}
```

## Direct Unit Tests

Fireworks demonstrate different operating with sending messages in the TON Blockchain.

![](/img/docs/writing-test-examples/test-examples-schemes.svg)

Once you deploy this with message `set_first` with enough TON amount, it will be automatically executed with primary and usable combinations of send modes.

Fireworks redeployed itself, as result it will be created 3 entities of Fireworks entities, while each of entity has own ID(keep it in storage) and, as a result, different Smart Contract Address.

For clearness define different by ID Fireworks instances (different `state_init`) with the following names:
* 1 - Fireworks setter - The entity that spread different launch op codes. Could be extended up to four different opcodes.
* 2 - Fireworks launcher-1 - The Fireworks instance, which launch first fireworks, means messages will be sent to the launcher.
* 3 - Fireworks launcher-2 - The Fireworks instance, which launch second fireworks, means messages will be sent launcher.


<details>
    <summary>Expand details on transactions</summary>


index - is an ID of a transaction in the `launchResult` array.
* `0` - External request to the treasury (the Launcher) that resulted with a outbound message `op::set_first` with 2.5 to fireworks
* `1` - The transaction in Fireworks setter contract invoked with `op::set_first` and executed with two outbound messages to the Fireworks Launcher-1 and Fireworks Launcher-2
* `2` - The transaction in the Fireworks launcher 1 invoked with `op::launch_first`, and executed with four outbound messages to the Launcher.
* `3` - The transaction in the Fireworks launcher 2 invoked with `op::launch_second`, and executed with a outbound message to the Launcher.
* `4` - Transaction in the Launcher with incoming message from the  Fireworks launcher 1. This message sent with `send mode = 0`.
* `5` - Transaction in the Launcher with incoming message from the  Fireworks launcher 1. This message sent with `send mode = 1`
* `6` - Transaction in the Launcher with incoming message from the  Fireworks launcher 1. This message sent with `send mode = 2`
* `7` - Transaction in the Launcher with incoming message from the  Fireworks launcher 1. This message sent with `send mode = 128 + 32`
* `8` - Transaction in the Launcher with incoming message from the  Fireworks launcher 2. This message sent with `send mode = 64`

</details>

Each 'firework' - is outbound message with a unique message body appears in transactions with ID:3 and ID:4.


Bellow the list of test for each transaction expected successfully executed. Transaction[ID:0] External request to the treasury (the Launcher) that resulted with a outbound message `op::set_first` with 2.5 to fireworks. In case you will deploy Fireworks to the blockchain launcher is your wallet.


### Transaction ID:1  Success Test

[This test](https://github.com/ton-community/fireworks-func/blob/main/tests/Fireworks.spec.ts#L75) checks if the fireworks are successfully set by sending a transaction with a value of 2.5 TON.
This is the simplest case, the main purpose here to assert result of transaction success property to true.

To filter certain transaction from the `launhcResult.transactions` array, we can use the most convince fields.
With
`from` (contract sender address), `to` (contract destination address), `op` (Op code value) - we will retrieve only one transaction for this combination.

![](/img/docs/writing-test-examples/test-examples-schemes_id1.svg)

The transaction[ID:1] in Fireworks Setter contract invoked with `op::set_first` and executed with two outbound messages to the Fireworks launcher-1 and Fireworks launcher-2

```typescript

    it('first transaction[ID:1] should set fireworks successfully', async () => {

        const launcher = await blockchain.treasury('launcher');

        const launchResult = await fireworks.sendDeployLaunch(launcher.getSender(), toNano('2.5'));


        expect(launchResult.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
            from: launcher.address,
            to: fireworks.address,
            success: true,
            op: Opcodes.set_first
        })

    });

```

### Transaction ID:2  Success Test

[This test](https://github.com/ton-community/fireworks-func/blob/main/tests/Fireworks.spec.ts#L92) checks if the transaction[ID:2] executed successfully.

![](/img/docs/writing-test-examples/test-examples-schemes_id2.svg)

The transaction in the Fireworks launcher 1 invoked with `op::launch_first`, and executed with four outbound messages to the Launcher.

```typescript
    it('should exist a transaction[ID:2] which launch first fireworks successfully', async () => {

        const launcher = await blockchain.treasury('launcher');

        const launchResult = await fireworks.sendDeployLaunch(launcher.getSender(), toNano('2.5'));

        expect(launchResult.transactions).toHaveTransaction({
            from: fireworks.address,
            to: launched_f1.address,
            success: true,
            op: Opcodes.launch_first,
            outMessagesCount: 4,
            destroyed: true,
            endStatus: "non-existing",
        })

        printTransactionFees(launchResult.transactions);

    });
```

In cases, when transaction should affect the state of contract, it is possible to specify this with `destroyed`, `endStatus` fields.

The full list of Account Status related fields:

* `destroyed` - `true` - if the existing contract was destroyed due to executing a certain transaction. Otherwise - `false`.
* `deploy` - Custom Sandbox flag that indicates whether the contract was deployed during this transaction. `true` if contract before this transaction was not initialized and after this transaction became initialized. Otherwise - `false`.
* `oldStatus` - AccountStatus before transaction execution. Values: `'uninitialized'`, `'frozen'`, `'active'`, `'non-existing'`.
* `endStatus` - AccountStatus after transaction execution. Values: `'uninitialized'`, `'frozen'`, `'active'`, `'non-existing'`.

        });

    })

```

## Printing and Reading Transaction Fees

During the test, reading the details about fees can be useful for optimizing the contract. The printTransactionFees function prints the entire transaction chain in a convenient manner."
```typescript

    it('should be executed and print fees', async() => {

        const launcher = await blockchain.treasury('launcher');

        const launchResult = await fireworks.sendDeployLaunch(
            launcher.getSender(),
            toNano('2.5'),
        );

        console.log(printTransactionFees(launchResult.transactions));

    });

```

For instance, in case of `launchResult` the following table will be printed:


| (index) |     op       |    valueIn     |    valueOut    |   totalFees    | outActions |
|---------|--------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|------------|
|    0    |    'N/A'     |     'N/A'      |   '2.5 TON'    | '0.010605 TON' |     1      |
|    1    | '0x5720cfeb' |   '2.5 TON'    | '2.185812 TON' | '0.015836 TON' |     2      |
|    2    | '0x6efe144b' | '1.092906 TON' | '1.081142 TON' | '0.009098 TON' |     4      |
|    3    | '0xa2e2c2dc' | '1.092906 TON' | '1.088638 TON' | '0.003602 TON' |     1      |
|    4    |    '0x0'     |  '0.099 TON'   |    '0 TON'     | '0.000309 TON' |     0      |
|    5    |    '0x0'     |   '0.1 TON'    |    '0 TON'     | '0.000309 TON' |     0      |
|    6    |    '0x0'     |  '0.099 TON'   |    '0 TON'     | '0.000309 TON' |     0      |
|    7    |    '0x0'     | '0.783142 TON' |    '0 TON'     | '0.000309 TON' |     0      |
|    8    |    '0x0'     | '1.088638 TON' |    '0 TON'     | '0.000309 TON' |     0      |

* `8` - Transaction on Launcher with incoming message from the Launched Fireworks - 2, message sent with `send mode = 64`


## Transaction Fees Tests

This test verifies whether the transaction fees for launching the fireworks are as expected. It is possible to define custom assertions for different parts of commission fees.

```typescript

  it('should be executed with expected fees', async() => {

        const launcher = await blockchain.treasury('launcher');

        const launchResult = await fireworks.sendDeployLaunch(
            launcher.getSender(),
            toNano('2.5'),
        );

        //totalFee
        console.log('total fees = ', launchResult.transactions[1].totalFees);

        const tx1 = launchResult.transactions[1];
        if (tx1.description.type !== 'generic') {
            throw new Error('Generic transaction expected');
        }

        //computeFee
        const computeFee = tx1.description.computePhase.type === 'vm' ? tx1.description.computePhase.gasFees : undefined;
        console.log('computeFee = ', computeFee);

        //actionFee
        const actionFee = tx1.description.actionPhase?.totalActionFees;
        console.log('actionFee = ', actionFee);


        if ((computeFee == null || undefined) ||
            (actionFee == null || undefined)) {
            throw new Error('undefined fees');
        }

        //The check, if Compute Phase and Action Phase fees exceed 1 TON
        expect(computeFee + actionFee).toBeLessThan(toNano('1'));


    });

```
