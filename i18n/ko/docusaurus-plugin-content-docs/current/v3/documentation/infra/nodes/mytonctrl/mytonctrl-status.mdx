## TON 네트워크 상태

### 네트워크 이름

Possible values are: `mainnet`, `testnet`, and `unknown`. However, the value `unknown` should never be displayed.

### 검증자 수

There are two key values: one represented in green and the other in yellow. The green value indicates the number of online validators, while the yellow value represents the total number of validators.

Both values must be integers greater than 0. You can obtain the green value using the command `getconfig 34` with MyTonCtrl. For more information, please check the [relevant section here](/v3/documentation/network/configs/blockchain-configs#param-32-34-and-36) regarding parameters 32, 34, and 36.

### 샤드체인 수

This value must be an integer greater than 0 and is displayed in green.

### 제안 수

- There are two values to note:
  - **Green**: Represents the number of `new offers`.
  - **Yellow**: Represents the total number of `all offers`.

### 불만사항 수

- Similarly, there are two values to consider:
  - **Green**: Indicates the number of `new complaints`.
  - **Yellow**: Indicates the total number of `all complaints`.

### 선거 상태

The election status can be indicated with green text for `open` or yellow text for `closed`.
