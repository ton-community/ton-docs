## Non-custodial software wallets (hot)

Non-custodial wallets provide users with complete control over their assets. The private keys are stored exclusively by the wallet owner, and access is secured through a seed phrase—a unique set of 12 or 24 words.

A software wallet, often known as a hot wallet, operates as software on a host device and stores your private keys in a device storage, such as a smartphone or laptop.
