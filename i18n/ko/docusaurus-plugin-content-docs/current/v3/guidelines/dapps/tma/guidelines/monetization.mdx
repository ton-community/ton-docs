TON Connect is a communication protocol that links **wallets** and **apps** in TON.

**Apps** built on TON provide rich functionality and high performance and are designed to protect user funds via smart contracts. Because these apps use decentralized technologies like blockchain, they are commonly referred to as decentralized applications (DApps).

**Wallets** provide the interface to approving transactions securely store users’ cryptographic keys on their personal devices. This separation of responsibilities enables rapid innovation and ensures a high level of security for users. Wallets do not need to create closed ecosystems, while apps do not need to bear the risk of storing users' accounts.

TON Connect enhances the user experience by enabling seamless interaction between wallets and apps.
