# Performance monitoring

## TON 서버 성능 모니터링

Tools such as `htop`, `iotop`, `iftop`, `dstat`, and `nmon` are effective for measuring real-time system performance; however, they fall short when it comes to troubleshooting performance issues that have occurred in the past.

This guide recommends using the Linux SAR (System Activity Report) utility for monitoring the performance of TON servers, and it provides an explanation of how to use it effectively.

:::tip
This guideline helps to identify whether your server experiences a resource shortage, not whether the validator engine performs badly.
:::

### 설치

#### SAR 설치

```bash
sudo apt-get install sysstat
```

#### 자동 통계 수집 활성화

```bash
sudo sed -i 's/false/true/g' /etc/default/sysstat
```

#### 서비스 활성화

```bash
sudo systemctl enable sysstat sysstat-collect.timer sysstat-summary.timer
```

#### 서비스 시작

```bash
sudo systemctl start sysstat sysstat-collect.timer sysstat-summary.timer
```

### 사용법

By default, the SAR gathers statistics every 10 minutes and shows statistics for the current day, starting at midnight. You can check it by running the SAR without parameters:

```bash
sar
```

전날이나 이틀 전의 통계를 보려면 숫자를 옵션으로 전달하세요:

```bash
sar -1   # previous day
sar -2   # two days ago
```

For the exact date, you should use the f option to point to the `sa` file of a given day within a month. Thus, for the September 23rd it would be:

```bash
sar -f /var/log/sysstat/sa23
```

To identify performance issues, it is essential to run specific SAR reports and analyze their results effectively.

The following list outlines the SAR commands that can be used to gather various system statistics. By combining these commands with the provided options, you can quickly generate reports for the desired date.

### 메모리 보고서

```bash
sar -rh
```

The TON validator engine uses the **jemalloc** feature, which allows it to cache a significant amount of data. As a result, the `sar —rh` command often returns a low number in the `%memused` column.

Meanwhile, you will typically see a high number in the `kbcached` column. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the low amount of free RAM indicated in the `kbmemfree` column. The key indicator to monitor is the value shown in the `%memused` column.

If the percentage exceeds 90%, you should consider adding more RAM. Additionally, keep an eye on your validator engine to ensure it doesn't stop unexpectedly due to an out-of-memory (OOM) issue. The best way to check for this is to grep the `/var/ton-work/log` file for any **Signal** messages.

**Swap usage:**

```bash
sar -Sh
```

If you notice that a swap is used, you should consider adding more RAM. The general recommendation from the **TON Core team** is to disable the swap.

### CPU 보고서

```bash
sar -u
```

If your server utilizes CPU on average up to 70% (see the `%user` column), this should be considered as good.

### 디스크 사용량 보고서

```bash
sar -dh
```

Watch the `%util` column and react accordingly if it stays above 90% for a particular disk.

### 네트워크 보고서

Use the commands :

```bash
sar -n DEV -h
```

또는

```bash
sar -n DEV -h --iface=<interface name>
```

네트워크 인터페이스 이름으로 결과를 필터링하려는 경우.

`%ifutil` 열의 결과를 확인하세요 - 최대 링크 속도를 고려한 인터페이스 사용량을 보여줍니다.

아래 명령을 실행하여 NIC가 지원하는 속도를 확인할 수 있습니다:

```bash
cat /sys/class/net/<interface>/speed
```

:::info
The speed you're experiencing is not what your provider promised you.
:::

Consider upgrading your link speed if `%ifutil` shows above 70% usage or columns `rxkB/s` and `txkB/s` reporting values close to a bandwidth provided by your provider.

### 성능 문제 보고

Before reporting any performance issues, ensure that you meet the minimum requirements for the node. Then, execute the following commands:

To generate today's report, run:

```bash
sar -rudh | cat && sar -n DEV -h --iface=eno1 | cat > report_today.txt
```

For yesterday's report, use the following command:

```bash
sar -rudh -1 | cat && sar -n DEV -h --iface=eno1 -1 | cat > report_yesterday.txt
```

Additionally, stop the TON node and measure your disk I/O and network speed with the command below:

```bash
sudo fio --randrepeat=1 --ioengine=io_uring --direct=1 --gtod_reduce=1 --name=test --filename=/var/ton-work/testfile --bs=4096 --iodepth=1 --size=40G --readwrite=randread --numjobs=1 --group_reporting
```

Look for the value at `read: IOPS=` and include it in your report. A value above **10K IOPS** is considered good.

Check your download and upload speeds using the following command:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sivel/speedtest-cli/master/speedtest.py | python3 -
```

Speeds exceeding **700 Mbit/s** are deemed satisfactory.

When reporting, please send the SAR report, IOPS, and network speed results to [@mytonctrl_help_bot](https://t.me/mytonctrl_help_bot).
