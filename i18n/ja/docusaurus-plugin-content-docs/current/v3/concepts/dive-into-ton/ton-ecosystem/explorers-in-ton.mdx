# TONのエクスプローラー

This article will consider TON explorers and their capabilities and features from the user's perspective.

## エクスプローラーとは何ですか?

An explorer is a website that allows you to view information in a blockchain, such as the account balance, transaction history, and blocks.

## どんなエクスプローラーが存在しますか？

TONエクスプローラーの中では、いくつかのカテゴリを区別できます:

- 日々の使用のために
- 開発者向けの拡張情報
- 専門分野

This division into categories is mainly conditional, and one explorer can belong to several categories simultaneously. So let's not pay too much attention to this.

## 一般的な機能

Blockchain explorers allow you to view and search the blockchain, similarly to how you might use a banking app to check transaction history and account balances. They provide a user-friendly interface to access real-time data about blockchain transactions, blocks, and addresses.

Just as you use a banking app to track where your money goes, who sends you payments, and when transactions occur, blockchain explorers let you see this information for digital assets on the blockchain. They are essential for transparency, allowing anyone to verify transactions independently, see the flow of cryptocurrency, and analyze the activity on the blockchain.

Typically, an explorer allows you to find a transaction or an account by its identifier. Some explorers also support DNS extensions or their own [address book](/v3/concepts/dive-into-ton/ton-ecosystem/explorers-in-ton#address-alias-in-explorers), which adds a human-readable label to a specific account. Example: [TON Foundation](https://tonviewer.com/UQAFmjUoZUqKFEBGYFEMbv-m61sFStgAfUR8J6hJDwUU04VW).
