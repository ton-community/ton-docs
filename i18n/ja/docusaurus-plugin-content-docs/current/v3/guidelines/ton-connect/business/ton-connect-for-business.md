## Adopting TON Connect

### Basic steps

In order for developers to integrate TON Connect into their applications the specialized TON Connect SDK is used. The process is quite simple and can be performed by accessing the correct documentation when needed.

TON Connect allows users to connect their applications with numerous wallets via a QR code or universal connectivity link. Apps can also be opened within a wallet using a built-in browser extension and it is critical to keep up to date with additional features that are added to TON Connect moving forward.

### Common implementation cases

By using the [TON Connect SDK](https://github.com/ton-connect/sdk), detailed instructions to integrate TON Connect allows developers to:

- connect their applications with carious TON wallet types
- backend login via the corresponding wallet's address
- sending request transactions and in-wallet signing(accepting requests)

To gain a better understand of what is possible with this solution, check out our demo app that is available on GitHub: [https://github.com/ton-connect/](https://github.com/ton-connect/demo-dapp)

### Currently supported technology stack:

- all web applications — serverless and backends
- React-Native mobile apps
- SDK for mobile applications in Swift, Java, Kotlin

TON Connect is an open protocol and can be used to develop DApps with any programming language or development environment.

For JavaScript (JS) applications, the TON developer community created a JavaScript SDK that allows developers to integrate TON Connect seamlessly in minutes. SDKs designed to operate with additional programming languages will be available in the future.
