# Get started with TON

Discover the speed, reliability, and core principles of asynchronous thinking by building your first application on the TON blockchain — from scratch.

:::tip 新人向けガイド
This is the perfect place to start if you're entirely new to programming.
:::

This learning path is split into **5** beginner-friendly modules and takes approximately **45 minutes**.

## What you will learn

In this step-by-step guide, you'll learn how to create and interact with the TON blockchain applications using JavaScript. While it's possible to figure it out independently, this path offers a faster, smoother experience — especially if you're starting.

Here's what you'll do:

1. Create your TON wallet using Tonkeeper.
2. Use a Testnet faucet to top up your wallet with test tokens.
3. Learn key smart contract concepts like **addresses** and **cells**.
4. Interact with the TON blockchain using the TypeScript SDK and an API provider.
5. Compile and send your first transaction using the NFT Miner console app.

_You're about to mine your first NFT rocket achievement!_
As one of the first TON explorers, you'll complete a Proof-of-work smart contract and unlock a hidden reward for your wallet. Let's dive in:

### TON ブロックチェーンの採掘方法

Today, we are going to teach our prospective builders how to mine on TON Blockchain. This experience helps you understand the significance of mining and why Bitcoin mining helped revolutionize the industry.

Although the proof-of-work giver smart contract framework, which defined the initial mining process that laid the foundation for TON, was completed at launch, the last TON was mined in June 2022 to conclude TON's proof-of-work (PoW) token distribution mechanism. That said, with our recent transition to proof-of-stake (PoS), the era of staking on TON has just begun.

では、**TON Developer**になるための最初のステップに焦点を当てて、TONでNFTを採掘する方法を学びましょう！ 以下は、私たちが目指しているものの例です。 Below is an example of what we're aiming to create.

<div style={{ width: '100%', textAlign: 'center', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <video style={{ width: '100%', borderRadius: '10pt', margin: '15pt auto', maxWidth: '90%' }} muted={true} autoPlay={true}
         loop={true}>
    <source src="/files/onboarding.mp4" type="video/mp4" />

お使いのブラウザはビデオタグをサポートしていません。

</video>
</div>

If we stay focused on the task at hand, we can create a miner in about half an hour.

## Getting started

開始するには、すべての開発者が次のコンポーネントを使用します。

- **Wallet**: テストネットモードでNFTを保存するには、保管されていないウォレットが必要です。
- **Repository**: 私たちはあなたのために設計された既製のテンプレートを使用します。
- **Developer Environment**:  Developers need to determine whether they want to mine in a local or cloud environment.

### Download and create a wallet

First, you need a non-custodial wallet to receive and store your TON. For this guide, we are using Tonkeeper.
You need to enable Testnet mode within the wallet to receive Testnet TON coins. These tokens will be used later to send a final minting transaction to the smart contract.

:::info
保管されていないウォレットでは、ユーザーはウォレットを所有し、秘密鍵を自分自身に保持します。
:::

To download and create a TON wallet, follow these simple steps:

1. スマートフォンにTonkeeperアプリをインストールします。 [here](https://Tonkeeper.com/)をダウンロードできます。 It can be downloaded [here](https://Tonkeeper.com/).
2. Next, you need to [enable test mode](/v3/concepts/dive-into-ton/ton-ecosystem/wallet-apps#tonkeeper-test-environment) within Tonkeeper.

Easy! Let's go to the development now.

### プロジェクトのセットアップ

We use a boilerplate to simplify your life and skip routine low-level tasks.

:::tip
Note that you need to [sign in](https://github.com/login) to GitHub for further work.
:::

[ton-onboarding-challenge](https://github) を使用してください。 om/ton-community/ton-onboarding-challenge) テンプレートは、「このテンプレートを使用」ボタンをクリックし、以下のように「新しいリポジトリを作成」タブを選択してプロジェクトを作成します。

<br></br>
<ThemedImage
    alt=""
    sources={{
        light: '/img/tutorials/onboarding/1.png?raw=true',
        dark: '/img/tutorials/onboarding/1-dark.png?raw=true',
    }}
/>
<br></br>

After completing this step, you'll have access to a highly performant repository that can serve as your miner's core. Congratulations!

### Development environments

The next step is to choose which developer environment best suits your needs, experience level, and overall skill set. As you can see, this process can be carried out using either a cloud-based or local environment. Developing on the cloud is often considered simpler and easier to get started. Below, we’ll outline the steps required for both approaches.

:::tip
Ensure you have opened the repository in your GitHub profile generated from the template in the previous step.
:::

<br></br>
<ThemedImage
    alt=""
    sources={{
        light: '/img/tutorials/onboarding/3.png?raw=true',
        dark: '/img/tutorials/onboarding/3-dark.png?raw=true',
    }}
/>
<br></br>

#### Local and cloud development environments

- Using a Javascript IDE can be challenging for users unfamiliar with it, especially if your computer and tooling systems are not configured for this purpose.

- しかし、NodeJS と Git に精通していて、 `npm` の使い方を知っているならば、 **ローカル環境**を使用する方が快適になるかもしれません。

#### Cloud codespaces

If you choose the cloud development environment, it's easy to get started by first selecting the _Code_ tab and then by clicking on the _Create codespace on master_ button within the GitHub repository shown below:

<br></br>
<ThemedImage
    alt=""
    sources={{
        light: '/img/tutorials/onboarding/2.png?raw=true',
        dark: '/img/tutorials/onboarding/2-dark.png?raw=true',
    }}
/>
<br></br>

このステップを完了した後 GitHub は、VSCODE Online IDE (Visual Studio Code Online Integrated Development Environment) にアクセスできる特別なクラウド ワークスペースを作成します。

Once access is granted (the codespace typically starts in about 30 seconds), you have everything required to begin without installing Git, Node.js, or other developer tools.

#### Local development environments

To set up a local development environment, you require access to these three essential tools:

- **Git**: Git is an essential tool for every developer working with repositories. It can be downloaded [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **NodeJS**: Node.jsはJavaScriptとTypeScriptのランタイム環境で、通常TONでアプリケーション開発に使用されます。 [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)をダウンロードできます。 It can be downloaded [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- **JavaScript IDE**. **JavaScript IDE**。JavaScript IDEは通常、ローカルの開発環境で開発に使用されます。このケースの例は Visual Studio Code ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)です。 An example of this case is Visual Studio Code ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)).

To get started, you need to clone your GitHub repository boilerplate and open the correct repository in your Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

#### Running scripts

In this guide, you'll need to run TypeScript scripts. All commands, such as running scripts or installing modules, are executed through the command line, which is located in the IDE's Terminal workspace, which is typically found at the bottom of the IDE.

For example, in the Cloud Codespaces, you should open the Terminal workspace if it is not already open:

<br></br>
<ThemedImage
    alt=""
    sources={{
        light: '/img/tutorials/onboarding/6.png?raw=true',
        dark: '/img/tutorials/onboarding/6-dark.png?raw=true',
    }}
/>
<br></br><br></br>

このウィンドウにコマンドを入力し、_Enter_ で実行します。

<br></br>
<ThemedImage
    alt=""
    sources={{
        light: '/img/tutorials/onboarding/4.png?raw=true',
        dark: '/img/tutorials/onboarding/4-dark.png?raw=true',
    }}
/>
<br></br><br></br>

The terminal is also available as a separate application. Please choose the appropriate version based on your IDE and OS.

Great! After these steps, you're ready to get deeper into TON Blockchain secrets.

## Connect to TON

では、TON Blockchainに接続するには何が必要ですか?

- **Smart contract address** as a point of destination. We aim to mine an NFT from the _proof-of-work smart contract_, so we need an address to determine the current mining complexity.
- TON Blockchainへのリクエストを行うための **API provider_** 。TON には、異なる目的で複数の [API タイプ](/v3/guidelines/dapps/apis-sdks/api-types) があります。 テストネット版の [toncenter.com](https://toncenter.com/) APIを使用します。 TON has multiple [API types](/v3/guidelines/dapps/apis-sdks/api-types) for different purposes. We will use the testnet version of [toncenter.com](https://toncenter.com/) API.
- **JavaScript SDK**: a JavaScript SDK (recall that an SDK is a Software Development Kit) is needed to parse the smart contract address used and prepare it to create an API request. To better understand TON addresses and why they need to be parsed to carry out this process, please see this [resource](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/addresses) to understand why we should parse it. To carry out this procedure, we use [`@ton/ton`](https://github.com/ton-org/ton).

In the next section, we describe how users send their initial requests to TON Blockchain using the TON Center API and `@ton/ton` to receive data from the PoW smart contract.

### Smart contract addresses

Let's cover the Mining Data command that translates different data parameters when programming mining data into TON Blockchain. These include:

1. **Wallet address**: a wallet address is required for the miner to receive their mining reward (in this case, we must use the [Tonkeeper Testnet mode](/v3/concepts/dive-into-ton/ton-ecosystem/wallet-apps#tonkeeper-test-environment)).
2. **Collection address**: a collection address is required to act as a smart contract to correctly mine an NFT (to carry out this process, copy the NFT collection address under the TON onboarding challenge collection name from the [Getgems website](https://testnet.getgems.io/collection/EQDk8N7xM5D669LC2YACrseBJtDyFqwtSPCNhRWXU7kjEptX)).

Next, we open the `./scripts/mine.ts` file in your miner and create a `mine()` function composed of initial constants as follows:

```ts title="./scripts/mine.ts"
import {Address} from '@ton/ton';

const walletAddress = Address.parse('YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS');
const collectionAddress = Address.parse('COLLECTION_ADDRESS');

async function mine () {


}

mine();
```

#### Using the async mine() function

Later, when creating a TON NFT Miner, several requests will be executed to the public API to relay responses to the correct code string in exchange for the desired instructions. Leveraging the async/await function dramatically improves code simplicity.

#### Address parsing

On TON, smart contract addresses come in different forms that employ numerous flag types. In this context specifically, we use the _user-friendly address form_. If you are curious to learn more about the different smart contract address types, feel free to check out this additional [resource](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/addresses) in our documentation.

鉱夫が正しく動作するには、2つの異なるスマートコントラクトアドレスタイプを追加する必要があります。 These include:

`@ton/ton` SDK にある arse()\` メソッドを使用すると、開発者はアドレスオブジェクトを作成して、あるフォームから別のフォームに変換することができます。

### Connect to an API provider

In this step, we'll connect with TON via TON Center, which is hosted on the toncenter.com API provider, using specific commands in the script.

The simplest way to do it is by specifying the Testnet endpoint `https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC`.

<br></br>

<ThemedImage
    alt=""
    sources={{
        light: '/img/tutorials/onboarding/5.png?raw=true',
        dark: '/img/tutorials/onboarding/5-dark.png?raw=true',
    }}
/>

<br></br>

We add `client` and `endpoint` in the `./scripts/mine.ts` script using _TonClient_ and Testnet TON Center endpoint `https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC`:

```ts title="./scripts/mine.ts"
import {Address, TonClient} from "@ton/ton"

// ... previous code

// specify endpoint for Testnet
const endpoint = "https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC"

// initialize ton library
const client = new TonClient({ endpoint });
```

:::info プロダクションではどうすればいいの?
Using an RPC node provider or running your own ton-http-api instance is better for that. Read more at the [TON Center API page](/v3/guidelines/dapps/apis-sdks/ton-http-apis).
:::

### Receiving mining data from TON Blockchain

最後に、プロセスの次のステップは、TON Blockchainから特定のマイニングデータを取得することです。

TONオンボーディングチャレンジを完了するために必要な[README ファイル](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-onboarding-challenge#mining-process-deep-dive)を参照することで、最新のTONマイニングデータは`get_mining_data`メソッドを実行することで得られます。 開始すると、結果は次のようになります: Once initiated, the result will be as follows:

As a result, we should receive an array with these fields:

```bash
(
	int pow_complexity,
	int last_success,
	int seed,
	int target_delta,
	int min_cpl,
	int max_cpl
)
```

#### Running smart contract get methods on TON

Using `@ton/ton` is possible to run the `client.runMethod(SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS, METHOD)` function.
Running this code will result in the following console output:

```ts title="./scripts/mine.ts"
// ... previous code

const miningData = await client.runMethod(collectionAddress, 'get_mining_data');

console.log(miningData.stack);
```

さらに、スクリプトを実行するには、format@@0(/v3/guidelines/get-started-with-ton#running-scripts)に次のコマンドを入力する必要があります。

```bash
npm run start:script
```

:::tip
To avoid unexpected issues, ensure you have finalized all previous steps, including inputting contract addresses.
:::

Good! As long as the above processes are executed correctly, a successful connection to the API will be achieved, and the necessary data will be displayed in the console. The correct console output should be initiated as follows:

```bash
TupleReader {
  items: [
    {
      type: 'int',
      value: 7237005577332262213973186563042994240829374041602535252466099000494570602496n
    },
    { type: 'int', value: 1730818693n },
    { type: 'int', value: 281644526620911853868912633959724884177n },
    { type: 'int', value: 30n },
    { type: 'int', value: 171n },
    { type: 'int', value: 252n }
  ]
}

```

The output above shows data on executing a process with a collection of numerical (_int_) values. The current focus is to convert this numerical output into a more practical format.

We need to convert the hex output to something _useful_.

:::info GAS PARAMETERS ON TON

1. To better understand how TON Virtual Machine (TVM) operates and _how TON processes transactions_, check out [TVM overview section](/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-overview).
2. Secondly, if you want to learn more about how transaction and gas fees work on TON, consider diving into [this section](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/transaction-fees/fees) of our documentation.
3. Finally, to better understand the exact gas values needed to carry out TVM instructions, see [this section](/v3/documentation/tvm/instructions#gas-prices) of our documentation.
   :::

では、チュートリアルに戻りましょう!

#### Numerical mining data in a user-friendly format

In the section above, we discuss numerical (_int_) values needed to receive mining data. Before processing, further received data must be converted into a more easily understandable and usable format.

As it is clear when examining the given output, numbers can be substantial. We will use `bigint` (the big number implementation in JavaScript) to deal with them. `BigInt` works with large numbers that are more significant than the maximum `number` integer values. Let’s use this example to get a better idea of the _Mining Data_ required for this process:

```ts title="./scripts/mine.ts"
// ... previous code

const { stack } = miningData;

const complexity = stack.readBigNumber();
const lastSuccess = stack.readBigNumber();
const seed = stack.readBigNumber();
const targetDelta = stack.readBigNumber();
const minCpl = stack.readBigNumber();
const maxCpl = stack.readBigNumber();

console.log({ complexity, lastSuccess, seed, targetDelta, minCpl, maxCpl });
```

As shown above, the different components of _miningData_ use stack-based numbers for different parameters, which will be introduced in the section below. To achieve the desired value outcome, we used the `stack.readBigNumber()` function to read a `bigint` from the stack.

After this process is complete, we may print values to the console. Try to run the script again by running the command:

```bash
npm run start:script
```

出力例を以下に示します。

```bash
{
  complexity: 7237005577332262213973186563042994240829374041602535252466099000494570602496n,
  lastSuccess: 1730818693n,
  seed: 281644526620911853868912633959724884177n,
  targetDelta: 30n,
  minCpl: 171n,
  maxCpl: 252n
}
```

Let's cover the Mining Data command that translates different data parameters when programming mining data into TON Blockchain. These include:

- `complexity`は鉱山労働者にとって最も重要な数です。値のプルーフ・オブ・ワークの複雑さです。最終的なハッシュがcomplexity_より小さい場合は成功します。 It's a Proof-of-Work complexity for the values. You're successful _if the final hash is less than complexity_.
- `lastSuccess` is a [unix timestamp](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/) date and time representation that keeps track of the last mining transaction on TON. Each time the last_success metric changes, it's necessary to rerun the miner because the seed also changes during this process.
- `seed` denotes a unique value a smart contract generates to calculate the desired hash. To better understand this process and learn more about how the seed changes and why, look at the project files folder using the `ctx_seed` keyword (Ctrl+F with the keyword `ctx_seed`).
- チュートリアルでは`targetDelta`、`minCpl`、`maxCpl`は使用されません。 しかし、スマートコントラクトでこれらがどのように使用されているかについては、プロジェクト内のコレクションのソースファイルで作業証明の複雑さを計算するための詳細をいつでも読むことができます。 But you can always read more about how they are used in smart contracts to calculate proof-of-work complexity in the source files of the collection in your project.

Now that we understand the parameters discussed above, we have the values(`complexity`, `lastSuccess`, `seed`) that we will use in our NFT Miner in the next chapter.

## Prepare an NFT miner

ねえ、あなたは素晴らしい仕事をしています！

After connecting to TON and retrieving the necessary mining data from the blockchain to create an NFT miner, let's focus on the next steps in this process to achieve our goal.

In this chapter, you will _prepare a mining message_ and _calculate a hash_ of the message. After that, you will _find a hash that's less(`<`) than the complexity_ we got from the smart contract.

それが鉱夫なのです! シンプルでしょう?

### Preparing mining messages

First, we must prepare a mining message by ensuring the correct parameters to ensure this process's validity and data integrity.

Thankfully, the [README file](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-onboarding-challenge#mining-process-deep-dive) allows us to retrieve the correct guidelines to achieve this goal. As you can see, the above README file comprises a table with specific fields and cell types (titled "Layout of proof of work cell') to help achieve our desired result.

:::info What are cells?
:::info 細胞とは？
Cells are data storage structures on TON that fulfill numerous purposes, including increasing network scalability and smart contract transaction speeds. We won't get into specifics here, but if you're interested in understanding the complexity of cells and how they work, consider diving into [this](/v3/concepts/dive-into-ton/ton-blockchain/cells-as-data-storage) section of our documentation.
:::

Fortunately, all the data structures used in this tutorial are already written in TypeScript. 幸いなことに、このチュートリアルで使用されるすべてのデータ構造はTypeScriptで既に記述されています。 _NftGiver.data.ts_ の `MineMessageParams` オブジェクトを使用して、_Queries_ でトランザクションをビルドします:

```ts title="./scripts/mine.ts"
import { unixNow } from '../lib/utils';
import { MineMessageParams, Queries } from '../wrappers/NftGiver';

// ... previous code

const mineParams: MineMessageParams = {
    expire: unixNow() + 300, // 5 min is enough to make a transaction
    mintTo: walletAddress, // your wallet
    data1: 0n, // temp variable to increment in the miner
    seed // unique seed from get_mining_data
};

let msg = Queries.mine(mineParams); // transaction builder
```

Probably you have a question: where are the _op_ and _data2_ from the [table](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-onboarding-challenge#mining-process-deep-dive)?

- In the table, the numerical value of data1 must equal that of data2. To omit the filling of the data2 value, the transaction builder performs a low-level process (see Queries.mine() sources).
- Because the `op` classification is always constant, it is already implemented in transaction builder _Queries_ and in _OpCodes_. You can find the opcode by going to the source code of the `mine()` method.

:::tip
Though it may be interesting to check out the source code (`../wrappers/NftGiver.ts`), but it is unnecessary.
:::

### Creating TON NFT miners

Now that we have completed the process to prepare messages for our TON miner, let’s jump into the initial process to create a miner.
First, let’s consider this line of code:

```ts
let msg = Queries.mine(mineParams);
```

Above, we compiled a `msg` value. The idea of mining is to find a hash `msg.hash()` that will be less than `complexity` from the last received _get_mining_data()_. We can increment `data1` as many times as we need.

The pure miner will continue to run indefinitely if `msg.hash()` is bigger than `complexity` (message hash is larger than PoW mining complexity).

TypeScript の `BigInt` に関連するコードの例を以下に示します。

```ts title="./scripts/mine.ts"
let msg = Queries.mine(mineParams);

const bufferToBigint = (buffer: Buffer) => BigInt('0x' + buffer.toString('hex'));

while (bufferToBigint(msg.hash()) > complexity) {
    mineParams.expire = unixNow() + 300;
    mineParams.data1 += 1n;
    msg = Queries.mine(mineParams);
}

console.log('Yoo-hoo, you found something!');
```

We convert the hash from the `msg.hash()` to `bigint `with the `bufferToBigint()` function. This is done to use this hash in comparison with `complexity`.

Though the miner will work properly after completing the above steps, it will have a visually unappealing appearance (try `npm run start:script`). Therefore, we must address this issue. Let’s jump in.

#### Improving TON miner appearance

私たちは今、鉱夫がセクシーに見えるようにしたいです! How do we do it?

Just follow me, my friend, follow me.

目標を達成するために、以下のコマンドを追加します。

```ts title="./scripts/mine.ts"
let msg = Queries.mine(mineParams); // transaction builder
let progress = 0;

const bufferToBigint = (buffer: Buffer) => BigInt('0x' + buffer.toString('hex'));

while (bufferToBigint(msg.hash()) > complexity) {
    console.clear()
    console.log(`Mining started: please, wait for 30-60 seconds to mine your NFT!`)
    console.log()
    console.log(`⛏ Mined ${progress} hashes! Last: `, bufferToBigint(msg.hash()))

    mineParams.expire = unixNow() + 300;
    mineParams.data1 += 1n;
    msg = Queries.mine(mineParams);
}

console.log()
console.log('💎 Mission completed: msg_hash less than pow_complexity found!');
console.log()
console.log('msg_hash:       ', bufferToBigint(msg.hash()))
console.log('pow_complexity: ', complexity)
console.log('msg_hash < pow_complexity: ', bufferToBigint(msg.hash()) < complexity);

return msg;
```

Just check it out! 見てみてください！コマンドを実行しましょう：

```bash
npm run start:script
```

<br></br>
<ThemedImage
    alt=""
    sources={{
        light: '/img/tutorials/onboarding/7.png?raw=true',
        dark: '/img/tutorials/onboarding/7-dark.png?raw=true',
    }}
/>
<br></br>

_Cool, isn't it?_

After executing these commands correctly, we'll have a visually appealing NFT miner. In the next section, we'll focus on connecting a wallet to the miner to create a payment channel that accepts and receives transactions from TON Blockchain.

## Prepare a transaction

Next, we'll outline the steps to compile a message and send it to the blockchain with your [Tonkeeper wallet](https://Tonkeeper.com/).
The upcoming steps will guide you in completing the process of **mining an NFT** on TON.

#### Top up wallet balance via the token faucet

We need to acquire some TON Testnet tokens to proceed to the next step. This can be achieved using the Testnet [faucet found here](https://t.me/testgiver_ton_bot).

### Leverage Blueprint transaction opportunities

To ensure that the NFT mining process is carried out correctly and that the user can store their NFT properly, we will use [Blueprint](/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/getting-started/javascript) to simultaneously interact with TON Blockchain and the Tonkeeper wallet.

To achieve this goal, we'll use the standard `run()` function to run to the creation of the transaction and send it:

```ts title="./scripts/mine.ts"
import { toNano } from '@ton/ton';
import { NetworkProvider } from '@ton/blueprint';

async function mine() {
  // code from previous steps
}

export async function run(provider: NetworkProvider) {
    // Do not forget to return `msg` from `mine()` function
    const msg = await mine();

    await provider.sender().send({
        to: collectionAddress,
        value: toNano(0.05),
        body: msg
    });
}
```

上記のスクリプトを実行してトランザクションを送信しましょう：

```bash
npm start
```

Note that we use `npm start` instead of `npm run start:script`. This is because we need to leverage the advantages of the blueprint (under the hood, `blueprint run` is called).

After running this command, answer the questions as shown below to connect your Tonkeeper wallet:

```
? Which network do you want to use?
> testnet
? Which wallet are you using?
> TON Connect compatible mobile wallet (example: Tonkeeper)
? Choose your wallet (Use arrow keys)
> Tonkeeper
```

Scan the QR code shown in the terminal with your Tonkeeper wallet to establish a connection; no transaction has been sent yet.
Once connected, confirm the transaction in Tonkeeper.

Do you sense the _experience_ in the air? That's you on your way to becoming a TON developer.

## Mine NFT with a wallet

TONでNFTを採掘するには、主に2つの方法があります。

- [簡単: NFT テストネットミンティング](/v3/guidelines/get-started-with-ton#simple-nft-testnet-mining)
- [成功法: NFT メインネットミンティング](/v3/guidelines/get-started-with-ton#genuine-nft-mainnet-mining)

### Simple: NFT Testnet mining

以下は、NFTを採掘するために最初のTestnetトランザクションを開始するために必要な手順です。

:::tip 最後のヒント
Because other developers may be carrying out the same process in an attempt to mine their own NFT, you may need to try the process a couple of times to succeed, as another user could mine the next NFT available right before you.

Soon after initiating this process, you will have successfully mined your first NFT on TON, and it should appear in your Tonkeeper wallet.
