# The Open Network

__The Open Network (TON)__ is a fast, secure, scalable blockchain focused on handling _millions of transactions per second_ (TPS) with the goal of reaching hundreds of millions of blockchain users moving forward.

TON is designed as a distributed supercomputer, or a “_superserver_”, intended to provide a variety of products and services to contribute to the development of the decentralized vision for the new internet. To learn more about different aspects of TON Blockchain and its underlying ecosystem consult the following resources:
