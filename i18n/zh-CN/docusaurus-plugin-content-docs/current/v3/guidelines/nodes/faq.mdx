## MyTonCtrl directory usage

MyTonCtrl is a wrapper that stores its files in two locations:

1. `~/.local/share/mytonctrl/`: Long-term files such as logs are stored here.
2. `/tmp/mytonctrl/`: Temporary files are stored here.

MyTonCtrl includes another script called `mytoncore`, which stores files in the following locations:

1. `~/.local/share/mytoncore/`: Permanent files, the main configuration will be stored here.
2. `/tmp/mytoncore/`: Temporary files and parameters used for elections will be saved here.

MyTonCtrl downloads its source code, along with the validator, into the following directories:

1. `/usr/src/mytonctrl/`
2. `/usr/src/ton/`

MyTonCtrl 将验证器组件编译到以下目录中：

1. `/usr/bin/ton/`

MyTonCtrl 会在此处为验证器创建一个工作目录：

1. `/var/ton/`

---

## 如果 MyTonCtrl 是以 root 用户身份安装的

配置将以不同方式存储：

1. `/usr/local/bin/mytonctrl/`
2. `/usr/local/bin/mytoncore/`

---

## 如何删除 MyTonCtrl

以管理员身份运行脚本，删除编译后的 TON 组件：

```bash
sudo bash /usr/src/mytonctrl/scripts/uninstall.sh
sudo rm -rf /usr/bin/ton
```

Ensure you have the necessary permissions to delete or modify files and directories.

## Directory changes with MyTonCtrl

### Changing validator working directory pre-installation

If you want to change the working directory of the validator before installation, you have two options:

1. **Fork the project**: You can fork the project and make your modifications there. To learn how to fork a project, use the command `man git-fork`.

2. **Create a symbolic link**: Alternatively, you can create a symbolic link with the following command:

   ```bash
   ln -s /opt/ton/var/ton /var/ton
   ```

This command will create a link at `/var/ton` that points to `/opt/ton`.

### Changing validator working directory post-installation

To change the working directory of the validator from `/var/ton/` after installation, follow these steps:

1. **Stop services**: First, stop the services using the following commands:

   ```bash
   systemctl stop validator.service
   systemctl stop mytoncore.service
   ```

2. **Move validator files**: Next, move the validator files with this command:

   ```bash
   mv /var/ton/* /opt/ton/
   ```

3. **Update configuration paths**: Ensure you update the paths in the configuration file located at `~/.local/share/mytoncore/mytoncore.db`.

4. **Consider experience**: Note that there might be limited experience with this type of transfer, so take this into account as you proceed.

Make sure you have sufficient permissions to execute these commands and make these changes.

## Understanding validator status and restarting validator in MyTonCtrl

This [document](/v3/guidelines/nodes/running-nodes/validator-node) will help you confirm if MyTonCtrl has become a full validator.

## Restarting your validator

If you need to restart your validator, run this command:

```bash
systemctl restart validator.service
```

Please ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute these commands and make any needed adjustments. <u>**Remember to back up important data before performing operations that may affect your validator.**</u>
