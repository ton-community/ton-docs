## Bird's eye view

**Apps** built on TON offer rich functionality and are designed to protect user funds through smart contracts. Since these apps use decentralized technologies like blockchain, they are typically called **decentralized applications (DApps)**.

**Wallets** offer the user interface for approving transactions and securely store users' cryptographic keys on their devices.

This separation of responsibilities allows for rapid innovation and a high level of security: wallets don't need to create closed ecosystems, and apps don't need to bear the risk of holding users' accounts.

TON Connect旨在提供钱包和应用之间的无缝用户体验。
