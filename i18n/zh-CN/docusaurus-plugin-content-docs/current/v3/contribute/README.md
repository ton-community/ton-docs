## Contribute rules

### Documentation maintain community

TON Documentation is entirely open source. Community enthusiasts and early TON contributors have played a key role in creating this open-source TON documentation by turning their notes into detailed pages.

It was initially written by TON [contributors](/v3/contribute/maintainers/) and supported by [TON Studio](https://tonstudio.io/).
We aim to educate users about TON through explicit, easily searchable content that appeals to technical experts and casual readers.

### How to contribute

This documentation is written in English. Please refer to [localization program](/v3/contribute/localization-program/how-to-contribute/) for other languages.

### 开发

- Learn the documentation development flow from a [ton-docs/README.md](https://github.com/ton-community/ton-docs?tab=readme-ov-file#set-up-your-environment-%EF%B8%8F) document.

#### Best practices for pull requests

1. **Keep your pull request small**. **保持你的拉取请求小**。较小的拉取请求（大约 300 行差异）更容易审查，也更有可能被合并。确保拉取请求只做一件事，否则就请拆分它。 Make sure the pull request does only one thing; otherwise, please split it.
2. **使用描述性标题**。建议遵循提交消息的惯例。 It would be best to follow the commit message style.
3. **测试你的更改**。在拉取请求的描述中讲述你的测试计划。 Run build locally, and make sure you have no crashes.
4. **对于文档来说**：编辑文档时，不要在 80 个字符处换行；相反，配置你的编辑器进行软换行。
