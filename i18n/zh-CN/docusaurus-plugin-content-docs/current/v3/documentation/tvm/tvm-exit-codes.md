# TVM Exit codes

If TVM exits with an arbitrary 16-bit unsigned integer `exit_code`. `exit_code` higher than 1, it is considered to be an _error code_, therefore an exit with such a code may cause the transaction to revert/bounce. 

## Standard exit codes

:::info
The list of standard exit codes contains all universal TVM exit codes defined for TON Blockchain. Alternative exit codes should be sought in the source code of corresponded contract.

| `2`       | Compute Phase | Stack underflow. Last op-code consumed more elements than there are on the stacks. <sup>1</sup>                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `3`       | Compute Phase | Stack overflow. More values have been stored on a stack than allowed by this version of TVM.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `4`       | Compute Phase | Integer overflow. Integer does not fit into −2<sup>256</sup> ≤ x < 2<sup>256</sup> or a division by zero has occurred.                                                                                                                                                                |

| `6`       | Compute Phase | Invalid opcode. Instruction is unknown in the current TVM version.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `7`       | Compute Phase | Type check error. An argument to a primitive is of an incorrect value type. <sup>1</sup>                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `8`       | Compute Phase | Cell overflow. Writing to builder is not possible since after operation there would be more than 1023 bits or 4 references.                                                                                                                                                           |
| `9`       | Compute Phase | Cell underflow. Read from slice primitive tried to read more bits or references than there are.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `10`      | Compute Phase | Dictionary error. Error during manipulation with dictionary (hashmaps).                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `11`      | Compute Phase | Most often caused by trying to call get-method whose id wasn't found in the code (missing `method_id` modifier or wrong get-method name specified when trying to call it). In [TVM docs](https://ton.org/tvm.pdf) its described as "Unknown error, may be thrown by user programs". | 
| `12`      | Compute Phase | Thrown by TVM in situations deemed impossible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `13`      | Compute Phase | Out of gas error. Thrown by TVM when the remaining gas becomes negative.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `-14`     | Compute Phase | It means out of gas error, same as `13`. Negative, because it [cannot be faked](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/ton/blob/20758d6bdd0c1327091287e8a620f660d1a9f4da/crypto/vm/vm.cpp#L492)                                                                                            |
| `32`      | Action Phase  | Action list is invalid. Set during action phase if c5 register after execution contains unparsable object.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `-32`     | Action Phase  | (the same as prev 32) - Method ID not found. Returned by TonLib during an attempt to execute non-existent get method.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `33`      | Action Phase  | Action list is too long.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `34`      | Action Phase  | Action is invalid or not supported. Set during action phase if current action cannot be applied.                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| `37`      | Action Phase  | Not enough TON. Message sends too much TON (or there is not enough TON after deducting fees).                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `40`      | Action Phase  | Not enough funds to process a message. This error is thrown when there is only enough gas to cover part of the message, but does not cover it completely.                                                                                                                             |

<sup>1</sup> If you encounter such exception in a func contract it probably means a type error in asm declarations.

:::info
Often you can see the exit code `0xffff` (65535 in decimal form). This usually means that the received opcode is unknown to the contract. When writing contracts, this code is set by the developer himself.
