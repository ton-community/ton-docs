# Shards

Sharding is a well-established concept that originated in  [database design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shard_(database_architecture)). It refers to splitting a single logical dataset into multiple independent databases that don’t share resources and can run across different servers.
In simple terms, sharding enables horizontal scalability—breaking down data into smaller, manageable parts that can be processed in parallel. This technique has been crucial in the evolution from traditional data systems to [big data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data).
As datasets grow beyond the capacity of conventional systems, sharding becomes the only practical way to scale effectively.

**Sharding in TON Blockchain**

TON uses sharding to handle a high volume of transactions efficiently.
The TON blockchain architecture includes one MasterChain and up to 2<sup>32</sup> WorkChains. Each WorkChain functions as an independent blockchain with its own rules. Furthermore, each WorkChain can be divided into up to 2<sup>60</sup> ShardChains or sub-shards, each responsible for a portion of the WorkChain’s state.

Currently, TON operates with only one WorkChain, known as the BaseChain.

The core principle behind sharding in TON is parallelism:
For example, if account A sends a message to account B and account C sends a message to account D, both transactions can be processed asynchronously and independently.

In the BaseChain (`workchain = 0`), the default configuration includes a single shard with the identifier `0x8000000000000000` which is `1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` in binary.
The MasterChain (`workchain = -1`) always operates with exactly one shard.

## MasterChain

The MasterChain is the main blockchain in the TON network. It stores the network configuration and the final states of all WorkChains. The MasterChain can be considered the core directory or the single source of truth for all shards and chains in the ecosystem.
It contains essential protocol-level information, including:

- The current network configuration;
- The list of active validators and their stakes;
- All active WorkChains and their corresponding ShardChains;
- The most recent block hashes of every WorkChain and ShardChain.

This data is key to maintaining consensus and ensuring all network parts are synchronized and operating securely.

## 工作链

The MasterChain is divided into individual blockchains called WorkChains. Each WorkChain is customized for specific transaction types or use cases and operates in parallel within the TON network.

## 独特性

在设计 TON 区块链时，我们做出了两个关键决定，使其在其他使用分片技术的区块链中独树一帜。

First, TON implements dynamic segmentation of the blockchain based on the network load. When the number of transactions reaches a critical threshold, the blockchain splits into two ShardChains. If the load on a shard continues to increase, it splits again—and this process continues recursively as needed. Conversely, when the transaction volume decreases, shards can merge back together. This adaptive sharding model enables the network to create as many shards as necessary at any given time.

Second, TON employs a non-fixed shard count. Unlike platforms such as Ethereum 2.0, which supports a fixed number of shards, e.g., 64, TON allows the number of shards to scale dynamically based on demand, with a theoretical upper limit of 2<sup>60</sup> shards per WorkChain. This virtually limitless capacity means the system could assign over 100 million shards to every person on Earth and still have resources remaining. This approach enables truly dynamic scalability — a necessity given the unpredictable nature of global network demand.

## 分割

在TON区块链中，单个账户的交易序列（例如 `Tx1 -> Tx2 -> Tx3 -> ...` ）被称为账户交易链或账户链（<b>AccountChain</b>）。这强调了它是与单个账户相关联的交易序列。
单个分区内的多个此类<b>账户</b>交易<b>链</b>组合在一起就形成了<b>分区链</b>。<b>ShardChain</b>（以下简称 "分片"）负责存储和处理分块内的所有交易，其中每个交易链都由特定的账户组定义。 This highlights that it is a linear transaction history specific to one account. Multiple **AccountChains** are grouped within a single shard, forming a **ShardChain**, hereinafter simply as a “shard”. A shard is responsible for storing and processing all transactions within its scope, with each transaction chain corresponding to a particular group of accounts.

These account groups are determined by a shared binary prefix, which clusters accounts into the same shard. This binary prefix is embedded in the shard ID, which is represented as a 64-bit integer with the following structure: `<binary prefix>100000...`. For example, a shard with the ID `1011100000...` contains all accounts that begin with the binary prefix `1011`.

When the number of transactions within a shard grows beyond a certain threshold, the shard splits into two new shards. These new shards are assigned IDs based on the parent shard’s prefix: `<parent prefix>01000...` and `<parent prefix>11000...`. They then become responsible for accounts starting with `<parent prefix>0` and `<parent prefix>1`, respectively. Block sequence numbers (seqnos) in the new shards continue from the parent shard’s last seqno plus one. After the split, the new shards operate independently and may progress at different rates, leading to divergent seqnos.

**Simple example**

默认情况下，在基本链（`workchain=0`）中只有一个分片，其分片号为 `0x8000000000000000`（或二进制表示为 `1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`）。主链（`workchain=-1`）始终只有一个分片。

MasterChain block contains information about the state of all shards in its header. Once a shard block is included in the header, it is considered final and cannot be reverted.

**Real example**

- MasterChain block `seqno=34607821` includes two shards:

  - `(0,4000000000000000,40485798)`
  - and `(0,c000000000000000,40485843)`

  [View source](https://toncenter.com/api/v2/shards?seqno=34607821)

- 主链区块 `seqno=34607821` 有 2 个分片：`(0,4000000000000000,40485798)` and `(0,c000000000000000,40485843)` (https://toncenter.com/api/v2/shards?seqno=34607821).

  - `(0,c000000000000000,40485844)`,
  - `(0,2000000000000000,40485799)`,
  - and `(0,6000000000000000,40485799)`

    [View source](https://toncenter.com/api/v2/shards?seqno=34607822)

    Note: The two new shards start with the same seqno but have different shard IDs.

- After 100 more MasterChain blocks (at `seqno=34607921`), the shard states have diverged:

  - `(0,2000000000000000,40485901)`
  - `(0,6000000000000000,40485897)`

## 合并

如果分片的负载下降，它们就可以合并回来：

- Two shards are eligible to merge if they share a common parent. In this case, their shard IDs will follow the format `<parent prefix>010...` and `<parent prefix>110...`. The resulting merged shard will have the ID `<parent prefix>10...`.
- For example, `10010...` + `10110...` merge into `1010...`.
- The first block of the merged shard will have `seqno = max(seqno1, seqno2) + 1`.

**Simple example**

**Actual example**

- 在主链区块 "seqno=34626306 "中，最后一个区块"(0,a000000000000000,40492030) "和"(0,e000000000000000,40492216) "的五个分片中的两个合并为一个区块"(0,c000000000000000,40492217)"（https://toncenter.com/api/v2/shards?seqno=34626306 和 https://toncenter.com/api/v2/shards?seqno=34626307）。

  新分片独立运行，100 个主链区块后（在主链区块 `seqno=34607921` 中），一个分片拥有最后一个区块 `(0,2000000000000000,40485901)`，另一个分片拥有 `(0,6000000000000000,40485897)`（https://toncenter.com/api/v2/shards?seqno=34607921）。
