<img align="left" width="300px" src="static\img\readme\about.png">

This is the official repository for The Open Network documentation.

Latest documentation release: [docs.ton.org](https://docs.ton.org).

Contribution guidelines: [How to contribute](https://docs.ton.org/v3/contribute).

TON Documentation is entirely open source. Community enthusiasts and early TON contributors have played a key role in creating this open-source TON documentation by turning their notes into detailed pages.

It was initially written by TON [contributors](/v3/contribute/maintainers/) and supported by [TON Studio](https://tonstudio.io/).

## Set up your environment ‚òÅÔ∏è

If you're changing the sidebar or adding media-files, links, please make sure that your submission won't break production.

You can do this in two ways:

### Cloud

Use Gitpod for contributing. It'll launch a workspace with a single click:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/ton-community/ton-docs)

### Local

1. Download repository from GitHub with its submodules

    ```
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/ton-community/ton-docs.git 
    ```

2. Install last version [NodeJS LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to run local build
3. Open Terminal in project directory
4. Install dependencies with command:

    ```
    npm install
    ```
5. Run project with command:

    ```
    npm run start
    ```
6. Build with multiple locales and run it locally

    ```
    npm run build
    npm run serve
    ```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Install recursive module

If you cloned the repository from GitHub without step 1, you'll need to install the submodules to enable local execution.
  ```
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```
