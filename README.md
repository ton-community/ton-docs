## Set up your Environment ☁️

If you are changing the sidebar or adding media-files, please check that your submission will not break production.

You can do this in two ways:

### Cloud (quick way)

Use Gitpod (a free, online VS code-like IDE) for contributing. It will launch a workspace with a single click:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/ton-community/ton-docs)

### Local (default way)

1. Download repository from GitHub
2. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to run local build
3. Use compitable node verison
    * [install nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
    * use node verison defined in .nvmrc
    ```sh
    nvm install && nvm use
    ```
4. Open Terminal in project directory
5. Install dependencies with command:

    ```
    npm install
    ```
6. Run project with command:

    ```
    npm run start
    ```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
